{"input": "I find Wikipedia's discussion of symbols of differential operators a bit impenetrable, and Google doesn't seem to turn up useful links, so I'm hoping someone can point me to a more pedantic discussion.\nBackground\nI think I understand the basic idea on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so for readers who know as little as I do, I will provide some ideas.  Any differential operator on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is (uniquely) of the form $\\sum p_{i_1,\\dotsc,i_k}(x)\\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial x_{i_1}\\dots\\partial x_{i_k}}$, where $x_1,\\dotsc,x_n$ are the canonical coordinate functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the $p_{i_1,\\dotsc,i_k}(x)$ are smooth functions, and the sum ranges over (finitely many) possible indexes (of varying length).  Then the symbol of such an operator is $\\sum p_{i_1,\\dotsc,i_k}(x)\\xi^{i_1}\\dotso\\xi^{i_k}$, where $\\xi^1,\\dotsc,\\xi^n$ are new variables; the symbol is a polynomial in the variables $\\{\\xi^1,\\dotsc,\\xi^n\\}$ with coefficients in the algebra of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nOk, great.  So symbols are well-defined for $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  But most spaces are not $\\mathbb{R}^n$ \u2014 most spaces are formed by gluing together copies of (open sets in) $\\mathbb{R}^n$ along smooth maps.  So what happens to symbols under changes of coordinates?  An affine change of coordinates is a map $y_j(x)=a_j+\\sum_jY_j^ix_i$ for some vector $(a_1,\\dotsc,a_n)$ and some invertible matrix $Y$.  It's straightforward to describe how the differential operators change under such a transformation, and thus how their symbols transform.  In fact, you can forget about the fact that indices range $1,\\dotsc,n$, and think of them as keeping track of tensor contraction; then everything transforms as tensors under affine coordinate changes, e.g. the variables $\\xi^i$ transform as coordinates on the cotangent bundle.\nOn the other hand, consider the operator $D = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, with symbol $\\xi^2$; and consider the change of coordinates $y = f(x)$.  By the chain rule, the operator $D$ transforms to $(f'(y))^2\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + f''(y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, with symbol $(f'(y))^2\\psi^2 + f''(y)\\psi$.  In particular, the symbol did not transform as a function on the cotangent space.  Which is to say that I don't actually understand where the symbol of a differential operator lives in a coordinate-free way.\nWhy I care\nOne reason I care is because I'm interested in quantum mechanics.  If the symbol of a differential operator on a space $X$ were canonically a function on the cotangent space $T^\\ast X$, then the inverse of this Symbol map would determine a \"quantization\" of the functions on $T^\\ast X$, corresponding to the QP quantization of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nBut the main reason I was thinking about this is from Lie algebras.  I'd like to understand the following proof of the PBW theorem:\n\nLet $L$ be a Lie algebra over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, $G$ a group integrating the Lie algebra, $\\mathrm{U}L$ the universal enveloping algebra of $L$ and $\\mathrm{S}L$ the symmetric algebra of the vector space $L$.  Then $\\mathrm{U}L$ is naturally the space of left-invariant differential operators on $G$, and $\\mathrm{S}L$ is naturally the space of symbols of left-invariant differential operators on $G$.  Thus the map Symbol defines a canonical vector-space (and in fact coalgebra) isomorphism $\\mathrm{U}L\\to\\mathrm{S}L$.", "output": "One way to understand the symbol of a differential operator (or more generally, a pseudodifferential operator) is to see what the operator does to \"wave packets\" - functions that are strongly localised in both space and frequency.\nSuppose, for instance, that one is working in $\\mathbb R^n$, and one takes a function $\\psi$ which is localised to a small neighbourhood of a point $x_0$, and whose Fourier transform is localised to a small neighbourhood of $\\xi_0/\\hbar$, for some frequency $\\xi_0$ (or more geometrically, think of $(x_0,\\xi_0)$ as an element of the cotangent bundle of $\\mathbb R^n$).  Such functions exist when $\\hbar$ is small, e.g. $\\psi(x) = \\eta( (x-x_0)/\\epsilon ) e^{i \\xi_0 \\cdot (x-x_0) / \\hbar}$ for some smooth cutoff $\\eta$ and some small $\\epsilon$ (but not as small as $\\hbar$).\nNow apply a differential operator $L$ of degree $d$ to this wave packet.  When one does so (using the chain rule and product rule as appropriate), one obtains a bunch of terms with different powers of $1/\\hbar$ attached to them, with the top order term being $1/\\hbar^d$ times some quantity $a(x_0,\\xi_0)$ times the original wave packet.  This number $a(x_0,\\xi_0)$ is the principal symbol of $a$ at $(x_0,\\xi_0)$.  (The lower order terms are related to the lower order components of the symbol, but the precise relationship is icky.)\nBasically, when viewed in a wave packet basis, (pseudo)differential operators are diagonal to top order.  (This is why one has a pseudodifferential calculus.)  The diagonal coefficients are essentially the principal symbol of the operator.  [While on this topic: Fourier integral operators (FIO) are essentially diagonal matrices times permutation matrices in the wave packet basis, so they have a symbol as well as a relation (the canonical relation of the FIO, which happens to be a Lagrangian submanifold of phase space).]\nOne can construct wave packets in arbitrary smooth manifolds, basically because they look flat at small scales, and one can define the inner product $\\xi_0\\cdot(x-x_0)$ invariantly (up to lower order corrections) in the asymptotic limit when $x$ is close to $x_0$ and $(x_0,\\xi_0)$ is in the cotangent bundle.  This gives a way to define the principal symbol on manifolds, which of course agrees with the standard definition.", "meta": {"post_id": 3477, "input_score": 74, "output_score": 47, "post_title": "What is the symbol of a differential operator?"}}

Of course it seems unreasonable to just port definitions of curvature into an algebraic context, but maybe there are constructions that play the same role in algebraic geometry that curvature does in other kinds of geometry.  Here are two specific ways the notion of curvature shows up which I can imagine making sense in more general contexts.\nAlgebraic Chern - Weil Theory?  In differential geometry one uses the curvature of a connection on a vector bundle to produce explicit cohomology classes.  Does this have an algebraic analogue?\nAlgebraic Curvature Bounds?  One supremely important theme in modern geometry involves proving theorems that depend only on the large scale geometry of a space, and the main strategy is to compare the space to a simpler one with the same large scale properties.  This reminds me a little bit of tropical geometry wherein one replaces an algebraic variety with a simple combinatorial proxy, but from what little I know the analogy seems to stop there.\nAny thoughts?

Namely the Atiyah class of the tangent sheaf can be used to define a Lie algebra structure (or more precisely $L_\\infty$) on the shifted tangent sheaf $T_X[-1]$, and Hochschild cohomology is its enveloping algebra. This Lie algebra acts as endomorphisms of any coherent sheaf (which is another way to say Hochschild cohomology is endomorphisms of the identity functor on the derived category), and one can take characters for these modules, recovering the characteristic classes defined concretely above.\n(In fact the notion of characters is insanely general... for example an object of any category - with reasonable finiteness - defines a class (or \"Chern character\") in the Hochschild homology of that category, which is cyclic and so descends to cyclic homology.

{"input": "It is well known that Feynman integrals are one of the tools that physicists have and mathematicians haven't, sadly.\n Arguably, they are the most important such tool. Briefly, the question I'd like to ask is this: what are the existing proposals for defining Feynman integrals rigorously and why don't they work?\nI should admit that my interest in all of this comes from attempts to understand Witten's definition of invariants of links in 3-manifolds (Comm Math Phys 121, 1989).\nHere are some comments on some of the existing approaches and a few specific questions. (And please let me know if I've missed any important points!)\nHere is a general framework. Suppose $E$ is a topological vector space of some kind and $L,f:E\\to\\mathbf{R}$ are functions. These are usually assumed continuous and moreover $L$ is (in all examples I know of) a polynomial of degree $\\leq d$ ($d$ is fixed) when restricted on each finite-dimensional subspace. The Feynman integral is $$Z=\\int_E e^{i L(x)}f(x) dx$$ where $dx$ is the (non-existent) translation-invariant measure on $E$ (the Feynman measure).\nThe way I understand it, this supposed to make sense since $L$ is assumed to increase sufficiently fast (at least, on the \"most\" of $E$) so that the integral becomes wildly oscillating and the contributions of most points cancel out.\nThe above is not the most general setup. In some of the most interesting applications there is a group $G$ (the gauge group) acting on $E$. The action preserves $L$ and $f$ and then what one really integrates along is the orbit space $E/G$, but still the \"integration measure\" on $E/G$ is supposed to come from the Feynman measure on $E$. Moreover, there is a way (called Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing) to write the resulting integral as an integral over $E'$ where $E'$ is a $\\mathbf{Z}/2$-graded vector space (a super vector space), which is the direct sum $E\\oplus E_{odd}$ with $E$ sitting in degree $0$ and $E_{odd}$ in degree 1.\nThere are two naive approaches to Feynman integrals -- finite-dimensional approximations and analytic continuation. Both are discussed in S. Albeverio, R. Hoegh-Krohn, S. Mazzucchi, Mathematical theory of Feynman path integrals, Springer LNM 523, 2 ed. As far as I understand, both work fine as long as $L$ is a non-degenerate quadratic function plus a bounded one. Moreover, in the 1st edition of the above-mentioned book Albeverio and Hoegh-Krohn give yet another definition, which works under the same hypotheses. \nHowever, one can try to do e.g. finite dimensional approximations for any $L$ (and probably renormalize as divergencies occur). So here is the first naive question: has anyone tried to find out what are the functions $L$ for which this procedure can be carried out and leads to sensible results?\nSince it is so difficult to define Feynman integrals directly, people have resorted to various tricks. For example, suppose $0$ is a non-denenerate critical point of $L$, so $L$ can be written $L(x)=Q(x)+U(x)$ where $Q$ is a non-degenerate quadratic function and $U$ is formed by the higher order terms. Introducing a parameter $h$ one can write (in finite dimensions and for a sufficiently nice $U$) the Taylor series for $\\int_E e^{i (Q(x)+hU(x))}f(x) dx$ at $h=0$ in terms of Feynman diagrams. This is explained in e.g. in section 2 of the paper \"Feynman integrals for pedestrians\" by M. Polyak, arXiv:math/0406251. When one tries to mimic this in infinite dimensions, one runs into difficulties: the coefficients of Feynman diagrams are given by finite-dimensional but divergent integrals (e.g. if $E$ is the space of functions of some kind on some manifold, then the integrals are taken along the configuration spaces of that manifold).\nA. Connes and D. Kreimer have proposed a systematic way to get rid of the divergencies (Renormalization in quantum field theory and the Riemann-Hilbert problem I: the Hopf algebra structure of graphs and the main theorem, arXiv:hep-th/9912092). I think I understand how it works in the particular case of the Chern-Simons theory, but I was never able to understand the details of the above paper. In particular, I'd like to ask: what are precisely the conditions on $Q$ and $U$ in order for this procedure to be applicable? What happens when we take the resulting series in $h$? If it diverges, is it still possible to deduce the value of the Feynman integral from it when the latter can be computed by other means (as it is the case e.g. with the Chern-Simons theory on a 3-manifold)?\nFinally, let me mention yet another approach to Feynman integrals: the \"white noise analysis\" (see e.g. Lectures on White noise functionals by T. Hida and S. Si). It was used by S. Albeverio and A. Sengupta (Comm Math Phys, 186, 1997) to define rigorously the Chern-Simons integrals when the ambient manifold is $\\mathbf{R}^3$ (they have to use gauge-fixing though). Since I don't know much about this I'd like to ask a couple of naive questions: Is there a way this could help one handle the cases other approaches can't? Can this help eliminate the necessity to start with a non-degenerate quadratic function?", "output": "Most of this is standard theory of path integrals known to mathematical physicists so I will try to address all of your questions.  \nFirst let me say that the hypothesis you list for the action $S$ to make the path integral well defined, ie that $S=Q+V$ where $Q$ is quadratic and non-degenerate and $V$ is bounded are extremely restrictive.  One should think of $V$ as defining the potential energy for interactions of the physical system and while it certainly true that one expects this to be bounded below, there are very few physical systems where this is also bounded above (this is also true for interesting mathematical applications...).  Essentially requiring that the potential be bounded implies that the asymptotic behavior of $S$ in the configuration space is totally controlled by the quadratic piece.  Since path integrals with quadratic actions are trivial to define and evaluate, it is not really that surprising or interesting that by bounding the potential one can make the integral well behaved.    \nNext you ask if anyone has studied the question of when an action $S$ gives rise to a well defined path integral: $ \\int \\mathcal{D}f \\ e^{-S[f(x)]}$\nThe answer of course is yes. The people who come to mind first are Glimm and Jaffe who have made whole careers studying this issue.  In all cases of interest $S$ is an integral $S=\\int L$ where the integral is over your spacetime manifold $M$ (in the simplest case $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$) and the problem is to constrain $L$.  The problem remains unsolved but nevertheless there are some existence proofs.  The basic example is a scalar field theory, ie we are trying to integrate over a space of maps $\\phi: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.  We take an $L$ of the form:\n$ L = -\\phi\\Delta \\phi +P(\\phi)$\nWhere in the above $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian, and $P$ a polynomial.  The main nontrivial result is then that if $M$ is three dimensional, and $P$ is bounded below with degree less than seven then the functional integral exists rigorously.  Extending this analysis to the case where $M$ has dimension four is a major unsolved problem.\nMoving on to your next point, you ask about another approach to path integrals called perturbation theory.  The typical example here is when the action is of the form $S= Q+\\lambda V$ where $Q$ is quadratic, $V$ is not, and $\\lambda$ is a parameter.  We attempt a series expansion in $\\lambda$.  The first thing to say here, and this is very important, is that in doing this expansion I am not attempting to define the functional integral by its series expansion, rather I am attempting to approximate it by a series.  Let me give an example of the difference.  Consider the following function $f(\\lambda)$:\n$f(\\lambda)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx  \\ e^{-x^{2}-\\lambda x^{4}}$ \nThe function $f$ is manifestly non-analytic in $\\lambda$ at $\\lambda=0$.  Indeed if $\\lambda<0$ the integral diverges, while if $\\lambda \\geq 0$ the integral converges.  Nevertheless we can still be rash and attempt to define a series expansion of $f$ in powers of $\\lambda$ by expanding the exponential and then interchanging the order of summation and integration (illegal to be sure!).  We arrive at a formal series:\n$s(\\lambda)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{n}}{n!}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx  \\ e^{-x^{2}}(-x^{4})^{n}$\nOf course this series diverges.  However this expansion was not in vain.  $s(\\lambda)$ is a basic example of an asymptotic series.  For small $\\lambda$ truncating the series at finite order less than $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^{2}}$ gives an excellent approximation to the function $f(\\lambda)$\nReturning to the example of Feynman integrals, the first point is that the perturbation expansion in $\\lambda$ is an asymptotic series not a Taylor series.  Thus just as for $s(\\lambda)$ it is misguided to ask if the series converges...we already know that it does not!  A better question is to ask for which actions $S$ this approximation scheme of perturbation theory itself exists.  On this issue there is a complete and rigorous answer worked out by mathematical physicists in the late 70s and 80s called renormalization theory.  A good reference is the book by Collins \"Renormalization.\"  Connes and Kreimer have not added new results here; rather they have given modern proofs of these results using Hopf algebras etc.\nFinally I will hopefully answer some of your questions about Chern-Simons theory. The basic point is that Chern-Simons theory is a topological field theory.  This means that it suffers from none of the difficulties of usual path integrals.  In particular all quantities we want to compute can be reduced to finite dimensional integrals which are of course well defined.  Of course since we lack an independent definition of the Feynman integral over the space of connections, the argument demonstrating that it reduces to a finite dimensional integral is purely formal.  However we can simply take the finite dimensional integrals as the definition of the theory.  A good expository account of this work can be found in the recent paper of Beasley \"Localization for Wilson Loops in Chern-Simons Theory.\"\nOverall I would say that by far the currently most developed approach to studying path integrals rigorously is that of discretization.  One approximates spacetime by a lattice of points and the path integral by a regular integral at each lattice site.  The hard step is to prove that the limit as the lattice spacing $ a  $ goes to zero, the so-called continuum limit, exists.  This is a very hard analysis problem.  Glimm and Jaffe succeeded in using this method to construct the examples I mentioned above, but their arguments appear limited.  Schematically when we take the limit of zero lattice size we also need to take a limit of our action, in other words the action should be a function of $ a$.  We now write $S(a)=Q+\\lambda V+H(a,\\lambda)$  Where as usual $Q$ is quadratic $V$ is not an $\\lambda$ is a parameter. Our original action is $S=Q +\\lambda V$ \nThe question is then can we find an $H(a,\\lambda)$ such that a suitable $a\\rightarrow 0$ limit exists?  A priori one could try any $H$ however the arguments of Glimm and Jaffe are limited to the case where $H$ is polynomial in $\\lambda$.  Physically this means that the theory is very insensitive to short distance effects, in other words one could modify the interactions slightly at short distances and one would find essentially the same long distance physics.  It seems that new methods are needed to generalize to a larger class of continuum limits.", "meta": {"post_id": 24823, "input_score": 92, "output_score": 53, "post_title": "The mathematical theory of Feynman integrals"}}

We say that $A$ has smaller-or-equal cardinality than $B$ if there is an injection $f:A\\to B$.

The pair of graphs\nwas constructed by a method, attributed to Schwenk, that I found in Doob's\nchapter of Topics in algebraic graph theory (edited by Beineke and Wilson).\nThe first 9 rows and columns of $A$, in common with $B$, come from a particular tree on 9 vertices that has a pair of attachment points such that extending the tree in the same way from either point gives isomorphic spectra.\nAdding a single pendant vertex cannot work for this problem, as I found using Brouwer and van Eijl's trick, mentioned\nby Chris Godsil, of comparing the Smith normal forms of (very) small polynomials in $A$ and $B$, in this case $A+2I$ and $B+2I$.  When a path of length two is added at either of the two special vertices, however, there doesn't seem to be any obstruction of this type.\nI then set about trying to conjugate both $A$ and $B$, separately, to the companion matrix of their mutual characteristic polynomial, by looking for a random small integer vector $x$ for which the matrix $X_A = [ x\\  Ax\\  A^2x\\  \\ldots\\  A^{10}x]$ has determinant $\\pm 1$, and similarly $y$ giving $Y_B$.  (The fact that I succeeded fairly easily may have something to do with the fact that $A+I$ is invertible over $\\mathbb Z$.)  The matrix\n$X_AY_B^{-1}$ then acts like the $C$ above.\n[EDIT: The actual matrix $C$ I found at random and first posted was not nearly so pretty, with a Frobenius norm nearly ten times the current example.  But taking powers 0 to 10 of $A$ times $C$ gave a $\\mathbb Q$-basis for the full space of conjugators, whose Smith normal form (as 11 vectors in $\\mathbb R^{121}$) was all 1's down the diagonal, so in fact it was a $\\mathbb Z$-basis.  Performing an LLL reduction on this lattice basis then gave a list of smaller-norm matrices, the third of which is the more illuminating $C$ given above, of determinant $-1$.  The other determinants from the reduced basis were all $0$ and $\\pm 8$.]\nTaking rational $x$ and not restricting the determinant of $X_A$ gives a space of possible rational matrices $C$ of dimension 11, which are generically invertible; varying $y$ gives the same space [EDIT: as does multiplying on the left by powers (or in the more general case commutants) of $A$].  Since the spectrum of $A$ has no repeated roots, this is also the dimension of the commutant of $A$, and every matrix conjugating $A$ to $B$ lies in this space.  Starting with a rational basis, it is not hard to find an exact basis for the integer sublattice, and taking the determinant of a general point in the integer lattice gives an integer polynomial in 11 variables which takes the value $1$ or $-1$ if and only if the matrices $A$ and $B$ are conjugate over $Z$.  If there are repeated roots, you have to work a little harder; in general the full space has dimension the sum of the squares of the multiplicities, and is generated by multiplying on the left by a basis for the commutator space of $A$.  A basis for the commutant can be produced (for a diagonalizable matrix) by first conjugating $A$ to a direct sum of companion matrices for the irreducible factors of the characteristic polynomial, and then one at a time, for each $k$-by-$k$ block corresponding to a $k$-times repeated factor of degree $m$, replacing each of the $k^2$ blocks with powers $0$ to $m-1$ of the companion matrix for that factor, with $0$ everywhere elsewhere.", "meta": {"post_id": 52169, "input_score": 30, "output_score": 41, "post_title": "Adjacency matrices of graphs"}}

{"input": "Not to sound like a refusenik or a contrarian, but I have always been a bit of an agnostic when it comes to the arXiv. Somewhere deep in my old Pine folders there is a 15 y.o. discussion with Greg Kuperberg on the subject, and it seems the history proved him right - the arXiv is now incredibly valuable and popular (perhaps, even a little too popular, see below).  However, despite all the benefits, I think posting on the arXiv is a serious decision, often enough a good idea, but not always, and definitely not without downside as Matthew Daws writes (to a wide 27+ support):\n But, definitely use the arxiv! I don't see any downside to putting a preprint on the arxiv; and it might lead to more people reading your work and hence more recognition.\nWhile benefits of the arXiv are well known and understood, as evidenced by the growth in the volume of submissions, I believe negative aspects are somewhat less known.  Thus, my question: \nDo you know any downsides of using the arXiv? \nIf yes, tell us what are they.  Is there a story behind?  If no, say nothing, of course. I start with a few (mostly minor) quips below to get this started (see also here for a rare critical blog post in another field).  \n\n1)  If you are a graduate student or a junior faculty, you might not be as fast as others in developing your own ideas.  As soon as you post early results which use your new ideas, they become a fair game. Now someone else can recognize their value and quickly solve your main problem before you are half way through.  On the other hand, going the more traditional print publication route would give a couple of years cushion, sufficient in most cases.  \n2)  On a related subject of destructive competition, arXiv can be really unhelpful.  One graduate student I know liked a conjecture posed in an arXiv preprint.  He solved it in about two months.  When he was finishing writing his solution, somebody posted an identical solution.  He was quite distressed.  Another graduate student I know, discovered two weeks before the Ph.D. defense that the main result in her thesis was just posted on the arXiv in a more general form by a senior faculty elsewhere.  Upon insistence of her advisor, she cancelled the defense and left academia without a Ph.D. degree.  \n3)  An obvious point:  some/many arXiv preprints are incorrect, leading to questions like this one.  This creates a bizarre \"neither solved nor open\" status: while a solution of an important problem is being checked, no one wants to work on the problem.  On rare occasions, two opposite solutions are posted leading to partial paralysis in the field.  BTW, plagiarism is yet another variation on this issue (here the authorship is incorrect).  \n4)  The other side of the same coin: if a person (like one friend of mine) posts an incorrect solution of a famous problem, this creates too much attention, potentially destroying a career (esp if in the early stages).  \n5)  The \"unaffiliated people problem\" which makes it hard from people from third world countries, as well as anonymous authors to contribute (not everyone is as brave as Mn\u0451v, see my answer here).  While arXiv's restrictions do help get rid of some cranks, there are other ways to do that, and one can argue that one gem from an unaffiliated author is worth 100 crank papers.  \n6)  Some people apparently read arXiv every day.  Really?  One friend of mine (in physics) admitted to me he spends 1.5-2 hours every morning doing that.  Really???\n7)  ArXiv's success also has downsides, as it increases pressure on young mathematicians to post, so as to keep up with others, even if their natural instinct in some cases maybe is to be protective of their ideas and further develop them before making them public.  The social pressure can be quite strong, as hiring committees increasingly view arXiv preprints as \"near publications\".  More anecdotally, one senior mathematician I know likes to ask people \"What's your most recent arXiv paper?\" in place of a more traditional \"What are you working on?\" as if arXiv posting is a \"must do\" for everyone. \n8)  An indirect and less obvious downside:  arXiv's success clearly slowed down rather than sped up the natural tendency to bypass traditional print publishers for electronic media, as there is less of a pressure to have all journals nearly free and widely accessible. This is contrary to the early predictions which expected for the transition to happen before 2010.", "output": "There is no downside to arXiv.  If you don't want to post a paper there, then don't.  If you don't want to read papers on arXiv or to study the daily collection of abstracts of papers just posted, then don't.  Nor is there any issue of plagiarism of ideas from arXiv that is different from plagiarism from a journal article.  To publish an article means to make it public.  A manuscript uploaded to arXiv is a publicly accessible and, therefore, a published manuscript, with the author's name attached to all the ideas, theorems, proofs, and conjectures that the paper contains.  \nThere is also an important democratizing aspect of arXiv.  In many fields of mathematics, preprints used to be circulated privately among a small group of insiders and their students.  It was difficult for outsiders to learn about new results and problems, and to \"break into\" the club.  It was essentially impossible for mathematicians in many poor countries to have access to research papers; the mathematicians were isolated and their universities could not afford journal subscriptions.  Now all they need is internet access to find out about current research.

Under reasonable growth conditions on $u_0$ and $u$ (e.g. $u_0$ and $u$ are at most polynomial growth), there is a unique solution $u$ to this problem given by the classical formula\n$$ u(t,x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi t}} \\int_{\\bf R} e^{-|x-y|^2/4t} u_0(y)\\ dy.$$\nHowever, as is well known, once one allows $u_0$ or $u$ to grow sufficiently rapidly at infinity, then smooth solutions to the heat equation are no longer unique, as demonstrated first by Tychonoff in 1935.\nMy question then concerns the corresponding question for existence : does there exist smooth initial data $u_0$ for which there are no global smooth solutions $u$ to the initial value problem for the heat equation?\nOne obvious candidate for such \"bad\" data would be a backwards heat kernel, such as\n$$ u_0(x) = e^{|x|^2/4}.$$\nOne can verify that\n$$ u(t,x) = \\frac{1}{(1-t)^{1/2}} e^{|x|^2/4(1-t)}$$\nis a smooth solution to the initial value problem for the heat equation with initial datum $u_0$ up to time $t=1$, at which point it blows up (rather dramatically).  However, this does not fully solve the problem due to the aforementioned lack of uniqueness; just because this particular solution $u$ blows up, there could be some other more exotic smooth solution with the same data which somehow manages to retain its smoothness beyond the time $t=1$.  This seems highly unlikely to me, but I was not able to demonstrate such an \"unconditional non-existence\" result - the absence of any growth hypotheses at infinity seems to destroy most methods of controlling solutions, and could potentially create some strange scenario in which one could continually keep singularities from forming by pumping in infinite quantities of energy from spatial infinity in just the right manner.

As you point out, this will not be unique.\nI can give a method of constructing such solutions now. The idea is to show that we can write $u=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_n$ where $f_n$ are carefully constructed solutions chosen such that the partial sums $\\sum_{n=0}^mf_n(0,x)$ eventually agree with $u_0(x)$ any bounded subset of the reals, and for which $f_n$ tends to zero arbitrarily quickly in the compact-open topology. First a bit of notation. I use $\\mathbb{R}^+=[0,\\infty)$ for the nonnegative reals. For a space $X$ then $C_0(X)$, $C^\\infty(X)$, $C^\\infty_0(X)$, and $C^\\infty_K(X)$, represent the continuous real-valued functions on $X$ which are respectively vanishing at infinity, smooth, smooth and vanishing at infinity, and smooth with compact support.

This is the Markov transition function for Brownian motion (more precisely, for standard Brownian motion scaled by $\\sqrt{2}$, because of the normalization used here). For $u\\in C_K^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$, then $f(t,x)=P_tu(x)$ is in $C_0^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^+\\times\\mathbb{R})$, and is a solution to the heat equation with initial condition $f(0,x)=u(x)$, agreeing with the classical solution stated in the question. I'll also consider initial conditions $u\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty))$ (for $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$) by setting $u(x)\\equiv0$ for all $x\\le a$. The first step in the construction is to find initial conditions supported in $(a,\\infty)$ so that $P_tu(0)$ approximates any given continuous function of time that we like.\n\n1) For any $a > 0$ and $h\\in C_0((0,\\infty])$, there exists a sequence $u_1,u_2,\\ldots\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty))$ such that $\\sqrt{t}P_tu_n(0)$ converges uniformly to $h(t)$ (over $t > 0$) as $n\\to\\infty$.\n\nConsider the closure, $V$, in $C_0((0,\\infty])$ (under the uniform norm) of the space of functions $t\\mapsto\\sqrt{4\\pi t}P_tu(0)$ for $u\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty))$. Note that the limit as $t\\to\\infty$ does always exist and is just the integral of $u$. Then $V$ is a closed linear subspace of $C_0((0,\\infty])$. Consider a sequence $u_n\\in C_0((a,\\infty))$ tending to the delta function $\\delta_b$ at a point $b > a$, in the sense that $u_n$ all have support in the same compact set, and converge in distribution to $\\delta_b$. Then, from the expression defining $P_t$, $\\sqrt{4\\pi t}P_tu_n(0)$ converges uniformly over $t > 0$ to $\\exp(-b^2/4t)$. So, the function $t\\mapsto\\exp(-b^2/4t)$ is in $V$. As the set of functions of the form $t\\mapsto\\exp(-b^2/4t)$ for $b > a$ is closed under multiplication and separates points, the locally compact version of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem says that $V=C_0((0,\\infty])$. Then, (1) follows.\n\n2) For any $u\\in C^\\infty_K((0,\\infty))$ and $a,T > 0$, there exists a sequence $u_1,u_2,\\ldots\\in C^\\infty_0((a,\\infty))$ such that $f_n(t,x)\\equiv P_t(u+u_n)(x)$ converges uniformly to zero (along with all its partial derivatives to all orders) over $t\\in[0,T]$ and $x\\le0$.\n\nChoosing $0 < \\epsilon < a$ so that the support of $u$ is contained in $(\\epsilon,\\infty)$, (1) implies that we can choose $u_n\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty)$ so that $\\sqrt{t}P_tu_n(\\epsilon)$ converges uniformly to $-\\sqrt{t}P_tu(\\epsilon)$ over $t\\ge0$ as $n\\to\\infty$.

It is then standard that the solution is given by an integral over the boundary,\n$$\nf_n(t,x)=\\int_0^t\\frac{\\epsilon-x}{\\sqrt{4\\pi (t-s)^3}}e^{-(\\epsilon-x)^2/4(t-s)}\\sqrt{s}P_s(u_n+u)(\\epsilon)\\frac{ds}{\\sqrt{s}}\n$$\nfor $x\\le0$. Differentiating this wrt $x$ and $t$ an arbitrary number of times, and using dominated convergence as $n\\to\\infty$, it follows that $f_n(t,x)$ (and all its partial derivatives) converge uniformly to zero over $x\\le0$ and $t\\in[0,T]$ as $n\\to\\infty$.\n\n3) Suppose that $T > 0$, $0 < a < b$ and $u\\in C^\\infty_K(\\mathbb{R})$ has support contained in $(-\\infty,-a)\\cup(a,\\infty)$.

The issue is how to think about gimbal lock.\nHow should you represent a rotation in three dimensions?  You can try using Euler angles to represent it using three rotation angles, but there's something fishy about this.  That naturally parametrizes a three-dimensional torus, but the rotation group is not a torus (rather, it's a projective space).  It doesn't even have a torus as a covering space, but rather a 3-sphere.  So the problem is that the naive coordinates just don't give the right topology, and therefore something must go wrong in degenerate cases to fix the topology.  Gimbal lock is essentially a name for what goes wrong.\nWhen people say quaternions avoid gimbal lock, they mean the unit quaternions naturally form a 3-sphere, so there are no topology issues and they give a beautiful double cover of the rotation group (via a very simple map).  Keeping track of a unit quaternion is fundamentally a more natural way to describe a rotation than keeping track of three Euler angles.\nOn the other hand, if you describe your quaternion via Euler angles, then gimbal lock shows up again, not in the quaternions themselves but in your coordinate system for them.  That's what you are seeing in your calculations: you are doing a standard calculation to see the effects of gimbal lock, and then redoing the same calculation using quaternions.\nSome explanations of gimbal lock don't distinguish clearly between the underlying geometry/topology and the choice of coordinates, which has always annoyed me, since that's essential for understanding what's going on mathematically.", "meta": {"post_id": 95902, "input_score": 31, "output_score": 66, "post_title": "The gimbal lock shows up in my quaternions"}}

Hence the order of $A$ cannot exceed $p^n-1$.\nOn the other hand, consider a degree $n$ monic polynomial $P_n$ whose root is a generator $\\xi$ of ${\\mathbb F}_{p^n}^*$. Then a matrix with $P_n$ as its characteristic polynomial has order at least $p^n-1$ since $\\xi$ is its eigenvalue.\nADDENDUM. if you wish the order to be the power of $p$, then the answer is $d=p^{\\lceil \\log_p n\\rceil}$. Since the order of $A$ is divisible by the multiplicative orders of its eigenvalues, all the eigenvalues should be $1$. Hence the characteristic polynomial is $(x-1)^n$, so $A^d-I=(A-I)^d=0$.\nOn the other hand, if $A=I+J$ is the Jordan cell of size $n$ (with eigenvalue 1), then $A^{d/p}=I^{d/p}+J^{d/p}\\neq I$, but $A^d=I+J^d=I$.\nNB. The subgroup of all (upper-)unitriangular matrices is a Sylow $p$-subgroup in ${\\rm GL}(n,p)$. So you may concentrate on it when looking at the elements of this kind.\nADDENDUM-2 (much later). This is to answer the question in the comments about the maximal order of an element $f\\in AGL(n,q)$, where $q$ is a power of $p$. Write $f(x)=Ax+b$.\nIf $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$, then $f$ has a fixed point (the equation $f(x)=x$ has a solution), so we may regard it as an element of $GL(n,q)$, and the maximal order of $f$ is again $q^n-1$.\nSo we are concerned with the case when the minimal polynomial $\\mu(x)$ of $A$ vanishes at $1$, say $\\mu(x)=(x-1)^k\\nu(x)$, where $\\nu(1)\\neq 0$. Then $A$ is similar to a block-diagonal matrix with blocks having minimal polynomials $(x-1)^k$ and $\\nu(x)$ (in view of $\\mathbb F_q^n=\\mathop{\\mathrm {Ker}}(A-I)^k\\oplus\\mathop{\\rm Ker}\\nu(A)$). So the order $d$ of $A$ does not exceed $p^{\\lceil\\log_p k\\rceil}(q^{n-k}-1)$ if $n<k$, and $p^{\\lceil\\log_p n\\rceil}$ otherwise. If $n>3$ (or $n=3$ and $q>2$), one may easily see that this bound does not exceed $q^{n-1}-1$. So $f^d$ is a translation, which yields that $f^{pd}=\\mathord{\\rm id}$, and $pd\\leq p(q^{n-1}-1)<q^n-1$. Thus the maximal order of $f$ in these cases is still $q^n-1$.\nWe are left with the cases $n=1$, $n=2$, or $n=3$, $p=2$. When $n=1$, the answer is obviously $\\max(p,q-1)$. When $n=2$, the only case left is $d=p=q$ achieved when $A$ is similar to the Jordan cell $\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$. In this case, $f^p(x)=x+(A^{p-1}+\\dots+I)b=x$ unless $p=2$, when $f^2(x)=x+\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}b$. So the answer is still $q^2-1$ when $q>2$, and $4$ otherwise.\nFinally, if $n=3$ and $q=2$, then the order of $A$ having eigenvalue $1$ exceeds 3 only if $A$ is similar to $3\\times 3$ Jordan cell (then $d=4$); but in this case $f^4=\\mathord{\\rm id}$. So this is not an exception.\nSumming up, the only cases when the order may be greater than $q^n-1$ are: (1) $n=1$, $q=p$ (the maximal order is $p$), and (2) $n=2$, $q=2$ (the maximal order is $4$).", "meta": {"post_id": 109483, "input_score": 21, "output_score": 48, "post_title": "maximal order of elements in GL(n,p)"}}

{"input": "Liouville's theorem from complex analysis states that a holomorphic function $f(z)$ on the plane that is bounded in magnitude is constant. The usual proof uses the Cauchy integral formula. But this has always struck me as indirect and unilluminating. There is a proof via harmonic function theory, but this also seems to involve an unnecessarily large amount of prior buildup. So one might seek a more direct proof as below.\nAssume that $f(z)$ is nonconstant. The fact that $f(z)$ is holomorphic at every point implies that at any given point, there is a direction such that moving in that direction makes $|f(z)|$ larger. But this doesn't prove that $|f(z)|$ is unbounded, because a priori its magnitude could behave like $5 - \\frac{1}{|z|}$ or some such thing. \nIn the case of $f(z) = \\frac{1}{P(z)}$ where $P(z)$ is a polynomial, one knows that $|f(z)|$ tends toward $0$ as $|z| \\to \\infty$ so that there's some closed disk such that if $|f(z)|$ is bounded, then it has a maximum in the interior of the disk, which contradicts the fact that one can always make $f(z)$ larger by moving in a suitable direction. But for general $f(z)$, one doesn't have this argument.\nOne can try to reason based on the power series expansion of a holomorphic function $f(z)$ that is not a polynomial. Because polynomials are unbounded as $|z| \\to \\infty$ and grow in magnitude in a way that's proportional to their degree, one might think that a power series, which can be regarded as an infinite degree polynomial, would also be unbounded as $|z| \\to \\infty$. This is of course false: take $f(z) = \\sin(z)$, then as $|z| \\to \\infty$ along the real axis, $f(z)$ remains bounded. The point is that the dominant term in the partial sums of the power series varies with $|z|$, and that the relevant coefficients change, alternating in sign and tending toward zero rapidly, so that the gain in size corresponding to moving to the next power of $z$ is counterbalanced by the change in coefficient.

Then by Brown representability, $E, F$ are represented by spectra, and the map $E \\to F$ comes from a map of spectra. However, it is possible that the map on cohomology theories is zero while the map of spectra is not nullhomotopic. In other words, the homotopy category of spectra does not imbed faithfully into the category of cohomology theories on finite CW complexes. This is due to the existence of phantom maps: \nLet $f: X \\to Y$ be a map of spectra. It is possible that $f$ is not nullhomotopic even if for every finite spectrum $F$ and map $F \\to X$, the composite $F \\to X \\stackrel{f}{\\to} Y$ is nullhomotopic. Such maps are called phantom maps. For an explicit example, let $S^0_{\\mathbb{Q}} = H\\mathbb{Q}$ be the rational sphere. This is obtained as a filtered (homotopy) colimit of copies of $S^0$ and multiplication by $m$ maps. The universal coefficient theorem shows that there are nontrivial maps $S^0_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\to H \\mathbb{Z}[1]$; in fact they are parametrized by $\\mathrm{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Q}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0$. However, these restrict to zero on any of the terms in the filtered colimit (each of which is a copy of $S^0$).\nIn other words, the distinction between flat and projective modules is in some sense an algebraic analog of the existence of phantom maps. Given a flat non-projective module $M$ over some ring $R$, then there is a nontrivial map in the derived category $M \\to N[1]$ for some module $N$. Now $M$ is a filtered colimit of finitely generated projectives -- Lazard's theorem -- and the map $M \\to N[1]$ is \"phantom\" in that it restricts to zero on each of these finitely generated projectives (or more generally for any compact object mapping to $M$). \nSo it should not be too surprising that phantom maps of spectra exist and are interesting. \nNow spectra are analogous to the derived category of $R$-modules, but spectra also come with another adjunction: \n$$ \\Sigma^\\infty, \\Omega^\\infty: \\mathcal{S}_* \\leftrightarrows \\mathcal{Sp}$$\nbetween pointed spaces and spectra.

That is, one assumes that the number in question is rational/algebraic, and constructs some quantity that can be shown to be bounded away from 0, less than 1, and also an integer.  To get these estimates, one typically needs some rapidly converging series expansion that is closely related the number of interest. For example the reason that Fourier's proof that $e$ is irrational is so simple is that we have a ready-made rapidly converging series $\\sum 1/n!$ for $e$ that allows us to  construct an integer between 0 and 1 from the assumption that $e$ is rational.  As for numbers like $\\pi$ or $e^\\pi$, they basically piggyback on the rapidly converging series $\\exp z = \\sum z^n/n!$ because $\\exp(i\\pi) = -1$.\nIn general, the less obvious it is how to relate your number to a suitable rapidly converging series, the harder it will be to prove irrationality/transcendence.

Later progress on $\\zeta(2n+1)$, particularly by Rivoal and Zudilin, relies on taking various subtle linear combinations of them in order to eventually deduce the nonexistent integer between 0 and 1, and so are only able to prove that at least one of a set of zeta values is irrational.\nSo could there be another proof that Euler missed out there, based on an elementary but non-obvious identity for $\\gamma$ that has the right properties for the usual machinery to grind through?\nMaybe, but currently there is no method in sight for relating $\\gamma$ in the right way to a suitable rapidly converging series.  If you like, that is the \"philosophical\" reason why we're stuck.\nBy the way, I'd highly recommend Making Transcendence Transparent by Burger and Tubbs if you want an accessible treatment of transcendental number theory.

The first part of this answer (written first) proves the finiteness; the second uses Noam Elkies' idea combined with a theorem of Fekete to prove the infinitude.\n\nFix $\\epsilon>0$. I will show that there are only finitely many integer values polynomial $f(z)$ with $|f(n)| < (\\tau-\\epsilon)^n$.\nLet $f$ be such a polynomial of degree $d$. Set\n$$\\frac{p(z)}{(1-z)^{d+1}} = \\phi(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f(n) z^n$$\nThen $p(z)$ has integer coefficients, $p(1) \\neq 0$, and we can uniquely recover $f$ from $p$. Moreover, there is some $M$ and some $\\delta_1>0$ (dependent on $\\epsilon$) so that $|\\phi(z)| < M$ on $|z|=\\tau^{-1}+\\delta_1$.\nWe make the change of variables $u = 1/(1-z)$, so $z=1-1/u$. We have $\\phi(1-1/u) = p(1-1/u) u^{d+1}$. Set $q(u) = p(1-1/u) u^{d+1}$. From the properties of $p$ above, $q$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree $d+1$, and $|q(1/(1-z))| < M$ when $|z|=\\tau^{-1}+\\delta_1$. The map $z \\mapsto 1/(1-z)$ sends $|z|=\\tau^{-1}+\\delta_1$ to a circle which contains the circle of radius $1+\\delta_2$ around $\\tau$ (for some $\\delta_2>0$).  So, using the maximum modulus principle, $|q(u)|<M$ on  the circle of radius $1+\\delta_2$ around $\\tau$.\nWe therefore make one more change of coordinates, $v=u-\\tau$ and $s(v) = q(v+\\tau)$, to get a polynomial $s$ with $|s(v)|<M$ on the circle of radius $1+\\delta_2$ around $0$. Although $s$ does not have integer coefficients, its leading term $v^{d+1}$ is a nonzero integer.\nChoose $D_1$ sufficiently large enough that $2 \\pi M (1+\\delta_2)^{-D_1-1} <1$. Then, for $D_2 \\geq D_1$, taking a contour integral around $|v|=1+\\delta_2$ shows that the coefficient of $v^{D_2}$ in $s(v)$ has absolute value $<1$. Since the coefficient of $v^{d+1}$ is a nonzero integer, this establishes that $d<D_1$. So we have bounded the degree of $f$. Thus, $f$ is determined by its values at $D_1$ integers, and there are only finitely many possible polynomials $f$.\n\nNow for the reverse bound. This argument is closely based on the proof of Fekete's Theorem here. (The original paper is here, but I don't speak German so I haven't checked whether they are the same argument.)\nOur first goal is to establish the following: Let $r < 1$. There exists a nonzero polynomial $q(u)$ with integer coefficients so that $|q(u)|<1$ on the circle $|u-\\tau|<r$.\nChoose an integer $T$ large enough that, for any $N > T$, we have\n$$r^N + (1/2) r^{N-1} + (1/2) r^{N-2} + \\cdots + (1/2) r^{T+1} + (1/2) r^T < 1/3.$$\nTake $N$ larger than $T$. Define $q^N_N(u) = (u-\\tau)^N$. Define $q^N_i(u)$ to be the unique polynomial of the form\n$$q^N_i(u) = q^N_{i+1}(u) + \\theta_i \\cdot (u-\\tau)^{i}$$\nso that $|\\theta_i| \\leq 1/2$ and the coefficient of $u^{i}$ in $q^N_i$ is an integer. Set $q^N(u) = q^N_T(u)$. So the coefficient of $u^k$ in $q^N(u)$ is an integer for $T \\leq k \\leq N$.\nFor $u$ on the circle $|u-\\tau|=r$, we get\n$$|q^N_T(u)| \\leq r^N + (1/2) r^{N-1} + \\cdots + (1/2) r^T < 1/3.$$\nLet $(c^N_{T-1}, C^N_{T-2}, \\ldots, c^T_0)$ be the last $T$, noninteger, coefficients of $q^N$. By the Pigeonhole principle, we can find $q^M$ and $q^N$ so that\n$$\\sum_i |\\{ c^N_i - c^M_i \\}| r^i < 1/3$$\nwhere $\\{ x \\}$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. We define $q(u)$ to be the result of taking $q^N(u) - q^M(u)$ and rounding the last $T$ coefficients to the nearest integer. We have now constructed $q$.\nWe now undo the above argument. Since $|q(u)|<1$ for $|u-\\tau|<r$, we have $|q(1/(1-z))|<1$ on the disc with diameter $(1-(\\tau+r)^{-1}, 1-(\\tau-r)^{-1})$. This contains the circle of radius $\\tau^{-1} - \\delta_1$ about $0$, where $\\delta_1 \\to 0$ as $r \\to 1$. So Noam's argument constructs infinitely many polynomials bounded by $(\\tau+\\delta_2)^n$.\n\nJust for the fun of it, I used the above construction to find a polynomial $\\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\theta_i (u-\\tau)^i$ with $|\\theta_i| < 1/2$ and all coefficients\nother than the constant term integral.

On the other hand, Lawson-Michelson and Berline-Getzler-Vergne use $v^2 = -q(v)$, I think because they want $\\text{Cliff}(\\mathbb{R}^n, \\| \\cdot \\|)$ to be the Clifford algebra generated by $n$ anticommuting square roots of $-1$. This is, for example, the correct Clifford algebra to write down if you want to write down a square root of the negative of the Laplacian (which is positive definite). \nFor 2), this choice affects the correct statement of the relationship between $\\text{Cliff}(n)$-modules and real $K$-theory, but there is something very confusing going on here, namely that with either convention, $\\text{Cliff}(n)$-modules are related to both $KO^n$ and $KO^{-n}$; see Andre Henriques' MO question on this subject. \nFor 3), whatever the answer to 1) or 2) I think everyone agrees that $\\text{Cliff}(X)$ should be given fiberwise by $n$ anticommuting square roots of $-1$, where $n = \\dim X$, so once you fix an answer to 1) that fixes the signs.

I'm not sure how important this choice is. \nAnyway, I just want to know whether there are good justifications to sticking to one particular set of conventions so I can pick a consistent one for myself; reconciling the conventions of other authors is exhausting, especially because I haven't decided what conventions I want to use.", "output": "This is not really an answer, but rather a meta-answer as to why there exist many conventions in the first place.\nThe symmetric monoidal category $\\mathit{sVect}$ of super-vector spaces has a non-trivial involution $J$.\nThe symmetric monoidal functor $J:\\mathit{sVect}\\to \\mathit{sVect}$ is the identity at the level of objects and at the level of morphisms.\nBut the coherence $J(V \\otimes W) \\xrightarrow{\\cong} J(V) \\otimes J(W)$ is non-trivial.

{"input": "In some situations, you need to show Lebesgue-measurability of some function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and the verification is kind of lengthy and annoying, and even more so because measurability is \"obvious\" because \"why would it not be\".\nIn such a situation, I have heard the argument: The function is clearly measurable, because the axiom of choice was not used to define it.\nThis argument makes some sense, because (as far as I know, I am not an expert) there are models of ZF (no C), where every function on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is Lebesgue measurable. So, suppose that we have a function $f$ in our model of ZFC constructed without the axiom of choice, then it is also a function in the model of ZF constructed above. Hence it is measurable there, and \"clearly\" all functions that are measurable in the model above are also measurable in our model.\nBut the question is: The bold statement above is very \"meta\". So how rigorous is this argument? Can it be made rigorous?\n/Edit: I changed \"Borel\"- to \"Lebesgue\"-Measurable.", "output": "The bold statement is not true in the generality in which you\nstate it. Nevertheless, something very like it is true, if one\nadopts the perspective and philosophy of large cardinal set theory\nand restricts the kinds of definitions that are considered.\nFirst, let's get a little more clear on what you mean. One does\nnot formally use axioms at all in a definition, but rather in a\nproof. To define an object means to provide a statement\n$\\varphi(x)$ that one and only one object satisfies. What one\nmeans by not using an axiom in a definition, is that one can\nprove, without using that axiom, that there is such a unique\nobject fulfilling the definition. Perhaps one has in mind a\nconstructive procedure, but this is really just a sequence of such\ndefinitions, and such a construction does not use the axiom of\nchoice, if at every step of the construction, the definition used\nat that step is a definition in any model of ZF.\nOne can easily make a counterexample, now, by the definition: let\n$f$ be the characteristic function of the least non-measurable set\nof reals in the constructible universe $L$, using the canonical \ndefinable well-ordering of $L$.\nThis definition does not use the axiom of choice, since it is\nsensible as a definition in any model of ZF, and picks out a\nunique function on the reals in any model of ZF. But it is not\nnecessarily true in ZF that this function is measurable, since if\nthe axiom of constructibility holds, that is, if we are living in\n$L$, then $f$ is definitely non-measurable. Meanwhile, it is\nconsistent with ZFC that the set of all reals in $L$ is countable\nin $V$, and in this case, the function $f$ is the characteristic\nof a countable set, and hence measurable in $V$. So the\ndefinition, which did not use the axiom of choice, sometimes\ndefines a measurable function and sometimes does not, in the\nvarious ZF worlds.\nLet's give another concrete counterexample. The canonical\nwell-ordering of the reals in the constructible universe $L$, mentioned by Andres,\nis a definable subset of the real plane $A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$,\nwhich in $L$ has complexity $\\Delta^1_2$ in the descriptive-set-theoretic\nprojective hierarchy. Thus, in our current universe $V$, the set $A$ has complexity at worst $\\Sigma^1_2$, and so it arises from a certain definable\nclosed subset of $\\mathbb{R}^4$ by projecting onto $\\mathbb{R}^3$,\ntaking the complement, and then projecting to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. So $A$ is definable in a highly concrete manner, without\nmaking any use of the axiom of choice. Nevertheless, it is not\nnecessarily true that the resulting set is measurable, since\ninside the constructible universe itself, the resulting set is not\nmeasurable; in contrast, it is also consistent with ZF that there\nare only countably many constructible reals, and in this case the\nset $A$ would be countable and hence measurable. So the\nmeasurability of the set $A$ is not determined, despite the simple\ndefinition.\nAt the end of your post, you seem to suggest that, (\"clearly\") if\na definition defines a measurable set in some model of ZF, then it\ndefines a measurable set (in our current ZFC universe). But this\nis not quite right. One can write down a definition $\\varphi(x)$\nthat ZF proves defines a unique set of reals, but the set of reals\ndefined is measurable in an inner model and non-measurable in a\nlarger model.\nLastly, let me explain the sense in which your bold statement is\non the right track. One of the truly surprising and remarkable\ndiscoveries of large cardinal set theory is that the existence of\nlarge cardinals has effects on fundamental mathematical truth at\nthe level of descriptive set theory. In particular, the existence\nof sufficient large cardinals implies that every projectively\ndefinable set of reals is Lebesgue measurable. If there is a\nsupercompact cardinal, and much less suffices, as explained in the\narticle Saharon Shelah, Hugh Woodin, Large Cardinals Imply That\nEvery Reasonably Definable Set of Reals Is Lebesgue Measurable,\nIsreal Journal of Mathematics, vol. 70, (1990) pp. 381-394 (reviewed by J. Bagaria in BSL 8:4(2002) pp. 543-545, as linked to by Andres in the comments), then every\nset of reals in $L(\\mathbb{R})$ is Lebesgue measurable. The universe $L(\\mathbb{R})$ consists of those sets that are constructible relative to reals.\nSo, if you assume large cardinals, and you define a set of reals\nby a definition that is absolute to $L(\\mathbb{R})$ \u2014 and\nthis is very likely the case if your definition works in ZF and\ndoes not involve set theory explicitly \u2014 then your set is\nLebesgue measurable.\nIn particular, assuming that there are sufficient large cardinals, then every projective set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, and this may provide a soft sufficient criterion. The projective statements are those that can be expressed using quantifiers only over the reals and the integers, with the usual algebraic and order structure. Alternatively, the projective sets are those that you get by closing the Borel sets under continuous images and complements. \nLet me point out that this kind of consequence of large cardinals\nis often pointed to by large cardinal set theorists as evidence\nthat the large cardinal axioms themselves are on the right track,\nsince they provide a such a rich, coherent and desirable structure\ntheory for our everyday mathematics. We infinitely prefer the\nsmooth and elegant descriptive set theory of large cardinals to\nthe awkward land of counterexamples provided by the axiom of\nconstructibility $V=L$.", "meta": {"post_id": 211507, "input_score": 39, "output_score": 44, "post_title": "Measurability and Axiom of choice"}}

Suppose for contradiction that $S$ is such a surface, and let me first assume that it is smooth and projective.\nFix $g\\geq 24$. Then the coarse moduli space of genus $g$ curves $M_g$ is of general type (this is due to Harris, Mumford and Eisenbud, see for instance [The Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves of genus $\\geq 23$]), hence a fortiori not uniruled.\n Let $H$ be the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of genus $g$ in $S$ and let $(H_i)_{i\\in I}$ be its irreducible components: the index set $I$ is countable. By hypothesis, the classifying morphism $H\\to M_g$ is surjective at the level of $\\mathbb{C}$-points. By a Baire category argument, there exists $i\\in I$ such that $H_i\\to M_g$ is dominant. \nSuppose that the natural morphism $H_i\\to \\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ is constant. Then $H_i$ is an open subset of a linear system on $S$, hence is covered by (open subsets of) rational curves. By our choice of $g$, $H_i\\to M_g$ cannot be dominant, which is a contradiction. Thus, $H_i\\to \\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ cannot be constant, which proves that $\\operatorname{Pic}^0(S)$ cannot be trivial. Equivalently, the Albanese variety $A$ of $S$ is not trivial.\nConsider the Albanese morphism $a:S\\to A$. The curves embedded in $S$ are either contracted by $a$ or have a non-trivial morphism to $A$. Those that are contracted by $a$ form a bounded family, hence have bounded genus. Curves $C$ that have a non-trivial morphism to $A$ are such that there is a non-trivial morphism $\\operatorname{Jac}(C)\\to A$, but this is impossible if $\\operatorname{Jac}(C)$ is simple of dimension $>\\dim(A)$. Consequently, a smooth curve with simple jacobian that has high enough genus cannot be embedded in $S$. This concludes because a very general curve of genus $g$ has simple jacobian (there even exist hyperelliptic such curves by [Zarhin, Hyperelliptic jacobians without complex multiplication]). \nAs pointed out in the comments, the argument needs to be modified if $S$ is non-algebraic or singular. I explain now these additional arguments.\nIf $S$ is smooth but non-algebraic, we can use the following (probably overkill) variant. We can consider the open space $H$ of the Douady space of $S$ parametrizing smooth connected curves in $S$. It is a countable union of quasiprojective varieties by [Fujiki, Countability of the Douady space of a complex space] and [Fujiki, Projectivity of the space of divisors on a normal compact complex space]. It has an analytic morphism to the analytic space $\\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ parametrizing line bundles on $S$ [Grothendieck, Techniques de construction en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie analytique IX \u00a73]. The dimension of $\\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ is finite equal to $h^1(S,\\mathcal{O}_S)$. The dimension of the fibers of $H\\to\\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ is at most $1$. Indeed, otherwise, we would have a linear system of dimension $>1$ on $S$ consisting generically of smooth connected curves, hence a dominant rational map $S\\dashrightarrow\\mathbb{P}^2$, showing that $S$ is of algebraic dimension $2$, hence that $S$ is algebraic. It follows that every connected component of $H$ has dimension $\\leq h^1(S,\\mathcal{O}_S)+1$. Now choose $g$ such that $\\dim(M_g)>h^1(S,\\mathcal{O}_S)+1$, and let $H_g$ be the union of connected components of $H$ parametrizing genus $g$ curves. A Baire category argument applied to the image of $H_g\\to M_g$ shows that there are genus $g$ curves that do not embed in $S$, as wanted.\nFinally, if $S$ is singular, consider a desingularization $\\tilde{S}\\to S$. The hypothesis on S implies that every smooth projective curve may be embedded in $\\tilde{S}$, with the exception of at most a finite number of isomorphism classes of curves (namely, the curves that are connected components of the locus over which $\\tilde{S}\\to S$ is not an isomorphism).

Since $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, $A$ is a discrete full rank sublattice of $V$. Each archimedean norm $| \\ |_v$ extends to a continuous homogenous function $V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ and we define $|\\ |$ on $V$ by \n$$|x|^2 = \\sum_v |x|_v^2$$\nwhere the sum is over archimedean places, this is a positive definite norm on $V$.

Write $B_R$ for the closed ball of radius $R$ around $0$.\nStep $1$: There is a nonnegative integer matrix $C$ whose rows sum to $2$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha$.\nChoose $M$ large enough that a ball of radius $M$, centered anywhere in $V$, contains a point of $A$. In other words, choose $M$ larger than the covering radius of the lattice $A$.\nChoose $R$ large enough that $cR/2+M < R$. \nI claim that, for any $z \\in B_R \\cap A$, there are $z_1$ and $z_2 \\in B_R \\cap A$ such that $\\alpha z = z_1 + z_2$. Proof: Let $z_1$ be the nearest point of $A$ to $\\alpha z/2$, and let $z_2 = \\alpha z - z_1$. Then $|z_1 - \\alpha z/2| = |z_2 - \\alpha z/2| \\leq M$ so $|z_1|$, $|z_2| \\leq |\\alpha z/2| + M \\leq cR/2 + M \\leq R$. We have shown that $z_1$ and $z_2$ are in $B_R \\cap A$ as desired.\nLet $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_N$ be the points of $B_R \\cap A$ and choose a way to write each $\\alpha z_i$ as $z_{j_1}+z_{j_2}$. Then the matrix $C$ which has $1$'s in positions $(i,j_1)$ and $(i,j_2)$ (and a $2$ if $j_1=j_2$) and $0$'s elsewhere has eigenvector $(z_1 \\ z_2 \\ \\cdots \\ z_N)^T$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha$ and all rows sum to $2$.\nBefore heading into step $2$, it is convenient to modify this argument slightly. Take $M$ large enough that any ball of radius $M$ contains at least $3$ points of $A$. In this way, we can ensure that, for any $z \\in B_R \\cap A$ we can write $\\alpha z = z_1 + z_2$ with $z_1$, $z_2 \\in B_R \\cap A \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$. \nWe can then take $z_1$, $z_2$, $\\dots$, $z_N$ be the points of $B_R \\cap A \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$. It will be convenient at the next step to make sure none of the entries of our eigenvector are $0$.\nStep $2$: We may assume that there is no way to permute the rows and columns of $C$ to give it the block structure $\\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} \\ast & 0 \\\\ \\ast & \\ast \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$. In other words, $C$ is irreducible in the sense of the Perron-Frobenius theorem.\nSuppose we could permute the rows and columns, so $C = \\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} C_{11} & 0 \\\\ C_{21} & C_{22} \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$ and $C \\vec{z} = \\alpha \\vec{z}$ where we can write the eigenvector $\\vec{z}$ as $\\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} \\vec{z}_1 \\\\ \\vec{z}_2 \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$. Then $C_{11}\\vec{z}_1 = \\alpha \\vec{z}_1$ We arranged above that none of the components of $\\vec{z}$ is $0$, so $\\vec{z}_1 \\neq 0$. We see $C_{11}$ is a smaller matrix with eigenvalue $\\alpha$ and row sums $2$, and we may consider it instead.\nStep $3$: Making the column sums $2$. So now $C$ has row sums $2$, meaning that $(1 \\ 1 \\ \\cdots \\ 1)^T$ is a right eigenvector with eigenvalue $2$. Let $(d_1 \\ d_2\\ \\cdots \\ d_n)$ be the corresponding left eigenvector. By Perron-Frobenius, the $d_i$ are all positive. Since the corresponding eigenvalue is rational, the $d_i$ can be taken to be integers. \nBuild a new matrix $D$ of size $\\sum d_i \\times \\sum d_i$, broken into $d_i \\times d_j$ blocks. We will arrange that it has eigenvalue $\\alpha$ with corresponding eigenvector $\\vec{w}:=(z_1 \\ z_1 \\cdots z_1 z_2 z_2 \\cdots z_2 \\cdots )^T$ where $z_i$ is repeated $d_i$ times. \nWithin the $d_i \\times d_j$ block, we will place $C_{ij}$ ones in each row. This is enough to force $D \\vec{w} = \\alpha \\vec{w}$ and to force the row sums to be $2$.\nMoreover, within the $d_j$ columns in the $j$-th block, there will be a total of $\\sum_i C_{ij} d_i$ ones. We have $\\sum_i C_{ij} d_i = 2 d_j$ by the choice of $d$ as a left eigenvector. \nSo we can place $2$ of them in each column and we win.\nBy the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem, a nonnegative integer matrix with row and column sums $2$ is a sum of two permutation matrices.

This is the expected behaviour of the M\u00f6bius function, and through various standard analytic number theory manipulations one can also use GRH to control correlations between the von Mangoldt function $\\Lambda(n)$ (which basically encodes primes) and various other functions, e.g. linear phases $e(\\alpha n)$.  On the other hand, GRH struggles to control self-correlations such as $\\sum_{n \\leq x} \\mu(n) \\mu(n+2)$ or $\\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda(n) \\Lambda(n+2)$ (the latter being used to count twin primes).  For instance, in the function field case GRH is a known theorem, but we are still unable to obtain an asymptotic (or even a lower bound of the right order of magnitude) for twin primes, though it is possible to establish the infinitude of twin primes in this case by more algebraic means.\nIn contrast, the existence of a Siegel zero means that there is a quadratic Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with which $\\mu$ has very high correlation (this can be quantified precisely using the \"pretentious\" approach to analytic number theory developed by Granville and Soundararajan).  This would be very unusual behavior for $\\mu$, and as such is actually a rather powerful piece of information.

{"input": "I am currently trying to decipher Mazur's Eisenstein ideal paper (not a comment about his clarity, rather about my current abilities). One of the reasons I am doing that is that many people told me that the paper was somehow revolutionary and introduced a new method into number theory. \nCould somebody informed about these matters explain exactly what subsequent developments did the paper bring, what ideas in the paper were considered more-or-less original (at the time it was published), and exactly what difficulties did these ideas resolve that people failed to resolve before the paper was published (if any)?", "output": "First, Mazur's paper is arguably the first paper where the new ideas (and language) of the Grothendieck revolution in algebraic geometry were fully embraced and crucially used in pure number theory.  Here are several notable examples: Mazur makes crucial use of the theory of finite flat group schemes to understand the behavior of the $p$-adic Tate modules of Jacobians at the prime $p$. He studies modular forms of level one over finite rings (which need not lift to characteristic zero when the residue characteristic is $2$ or $3$). He proves theorems about mod-$p$ modular forms using what are essentially comparison theorems between etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology, and many more examples. The proof of the main theorem ($\\S5$, starting at page 156) is itself a very modern proof which fundamentally uses the viewpoint of $X_0(N)$ as a scheme.\nSecond, there are many beautiful ideas which have their original in this paper: it contains many of the first innovative ideas for studying $2$-dimensional (and beyond) Galois representations, including the link between geometric properties (multiplicity one) and arithmetic properties, geometric conceptions for studying congruences between Galois representations, understanding the importance of the finite-flat property of group schemes, and the identification of the Gorenstein property. There is a theoretical $p$-descent on the Eisenstein quotient when previously descents were almost all explicit $2$-descents with specific equations. It introduces the winding quotient, and so on.\nThird, while it is a dense paper, it is dense in the best possible way: many of the small diversions could have made interesting papers on their own. Indeed, even close readers of the paper today can find connections between Mazur's asides and cutting edge mathematics. When Mazur raises a question in the text, it is almost invariably very interesting. One particular (great) habit that Mazur has is thinking about various isomorphisms and by pinning down various canonical choices identifies refined invariants. To take a random example, consider his exploration of the Shimura subgroup at the end of section 11. He finishes with a question which to a casual reader may as well be a throw-away remark. But this question was first solved by Merel, and more recently generalized in some very nice work of Emmanuel Lecouturier. Lecouturier's ideas then played an important role in the work of Michael Harris and Akshay Venkatesh. Again, one could give many more such examples of this. Very few papers have the richness of footnotes and asides that this paper does. Never forget that one of the hardest things in mathematics is coming up with interesting questions and observations, and this paper contains many great ones - it is bursting with the ideas of a truly creative mathematician.\nFinally, the result itself is amazing, and (pretty much) remains the only method available for proving the main theorem (the second proof due to Mazur is very related to this one). To give a sense of how great the theorem is, note that if $E$ is a semistable elliptic curve, then either $E$ is isogenous to a curve with a $p$-torsion point, or $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. This result (added for clarity: explicitly, Mazur's Theorem that $E/\\mathbf{Q}$ doesn't have a $p$-torsion point for $p > 7$) is crucially used in Wiles' proof of Fermat. One could certainly argue that without this paper (and how it transformed algebraic number theory) we would not have had Wiles' proof of Fermat, but it's even literally true that Mazur's theorem was (and remains so today, over 40 years later) an essential step in any proof of Fermat.", "meta": {"post_id": 332022, "input_score": 64, "output_score": 100, "post_title": "Why is the Eisenstein ideal paper so great?"}}

But, these numbers do not seem to play any 'mathematical' role.\nTo clarify my questions,\n\nWhat forbids me from proclaiming that $\\phi$ is dimensionless instead of mass dimension $1$?\n\nWhat is the exact difference between a dimensionless coupling constant and a coupling constant of mass dimension $-1$?\n\n\nThese issues seem very fundamental but always confuse me. Could anyone please provide a precise answer?", "output": "Mathematically, the concept of a physical dimension is expressed using one-dimensional vector spaces and their tensor products.\nFor example, consider mass.\nYou can add masses together and you know how to multiply a mass by a real number.\nThus, masses should form a one-dimensional real vector space $M$.\nThe same reasoning applies to other physical quantities, like length, time, temperature, etc.\nDenote the corresponding one-dimensional vector spaces by $L$, $T$, etc.\nWhen you multiply (say) some mass $m\u2208M$ and some length $l\u2208L$,\nthe result is $m\u2297l\u2208M\u2297L$.\nHere $M\u2297L$ is another one-dimensional real vector space,\nwhich is capable of \u201cstoring\u201d physical quantities of dimension mass times length.\nMultiplicative inverses live in the dual space:\nif $m\u2208M$, then $m^{-1}\u2208M^*$, where $\\def\\Hom{\\mathop{\\rm Hom}} \\def\\R{{\\bf R}} M^*=\\Hom(M,\\R)$.\nThe element $m^{-1}$ is defined as the unique element in $M^*$\nsuch that $m^{-1}(m)=1$, where $-(-)$ denotes the evaluation\nof a linear functional on $M$ on an element of $M$.\nObserve that $m \u2297 m^{-1} \u2208 M\u2297M^* \u2245 \\R$, where the latter canonical isomorphism\nsends $(f,m)$ to $f(m)$, so $m^{-1}$ is indeed the inverse of $m$.\nNext, you can also define powers of physical quantities,\ni.e., $m^t$, where $m\u2208M$ is a mass and $t\u2208\\R$ is a real number.\nThis is done using the notion of a density from differential geometry.\n(The case $\\def\\C{{\\bf C}} t\\in\\C$ works similarly, but with\ncomplex one-dimensional vector spaces.)\nIn order to do this, we must make $M$ into an oriented vector space.\nFor a one-dimensional vector space, this simply means that\nwe declare one out of the two half-rays in $M\u2216\\{0\\}$ to be positive,\nand denote it by $M_{>0}$.\nThis makes perfect sense for physical quantities like mass, length, temperature.\nOnce you have an orientation on $M$,\nyou can define $\\def\\Dens{\\mathop{\\rm Dens}} \\Dens_d(M)$\nfor $d\u2208\\R$ as the one-dimensional (oriented) real vector space\nwhose elements are equivalence classes of pairs $(a,m)$,\nwhere $a\u2208\\R$, $m\u2208M_{>0}$.\nThe equivalence relation is defined as follows:\n$(a,b\u22c5m)\u223c(a b^d,m)$ for any $b\u2208\\R_{>0}$.\nThe vector space operations are defined as follows:\n$0=(0,m)$ for some $m\u2208M_{>0}$,\n$-(a,m)=(-a,m)$,\n$(a,m)+(a',m)=(a+a',m)$,\nand $s(a,m)=(sa,m)$.\nIt suffices to add pairs with the same\nsecond component $m$ because the equivalence relation allows you to change the second component arbitrarily.\nOnce we have defined $\\Dens_d(M)$, given $m\u2208M_{>0}$ and $d\u2208\\R$,\nwe define $m^d\u2208\\Dens_d(M)$ as the equivalence class of the pair $(1,m)$.\nIt is easy to verify that all the usual laws of arithmetic,\nlike $m^d m^e = m^{d+e}$, $m^d n^d = (mn)^d$, etc.,\nare satisfied, provided that multiplication and reciprocals are interpreted as explained above.\nUsing the power operation operations we just defined,\nwe can now see that the equivalence class of $(a,m)$\nis equal to $a\u22c5m^d$, where $m\u2208M_{>0}$, $m^d\u2208\\Dens_d(M)_{>0}$,\nand $a\u22c5m^d\u2208\\Dens_d(M)$.\nThis makes the meaning of the equivalence relation clear.\nIn particular, for $d=-1$ we have a canonical isomorphism $\\Dens_{-1}(M)\u2192M^*$\nthat sends the equivalence class of $(1,m)$ to the element $m^{-1}\u2208M^*$ defined above,\nso the two notions of a reciprocal element coincide.\nIf you are dealing with temperature without knowing about the absolute zero,\nit can be modeled as a one-dimensional real affine space.\nThat is, you can make sense of a linear combination\n$$a_1 t_1 + a_2 t_2 + a_3 t_3$$\nof temperatures $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$\nas long as $a_1+a_2+a_3=1$,\nand you don't need to know about the absolute zero to do this.\nThe calculus of physical quantities can be extended\nto one-dimensional real affine spaces without much difficulty.\nNone of the above constructions make any noncanonical choices of\nphysical units (such as a unit of mass, for example).\nOf course, if you do fix such a unit $\u03bc\u2208M_{>0}$, you can construct\nan isomorphism $\\R\u2192\\Dens_d(M)$ that sends $a\u2208\\R$ to $a\u03bc^d$,\nand the above calculus (including the power operations)\nis identified with the usual operations on real numbers.\nIn general relativity, we no longer have a single one-dimensional\nvector space for length.\nInstead, we have the tangent bundle,\nwhose elements model (infinitesimal) displacements.\nThus, physical quantities no longer live in a fixed one-dimensional\nvector space, but rather are sections of a one-dimensional\nvector bundle constructed from the tangent bundle.\nFor example, the volume is an element of the total space\nof the line bundle of 1-densities $\\Dens_1(T M)$,\nand the length is now given by the line-bundle of $\u03bb$-densities $\\Dens_\u03bb(T M)$, where $\u03bb=1/\\dim M$.", "meta": {"post_id": 402497, "input_score": 27, "output_score": 56, "post_title": "How do we give mathematical meaning to 'physical dimensions'?"}}

One can intuitively think of the graph of $f$ as the trajectory of a light ray passing through different media that travels in straight lines until it hits one of the flat boundaries $f(t)=t$, $f(t)=2t$, $f(t)=3t$, etc., at which point it \"refracts\" to a different slope.

The blue term would be dropped if there are no exceptional characters modulo $q$.\nTo unify the error terms, we require a result due to Siegel (1935):\nTheorem 2 (Siegel): For all $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists some $A_\\varepsilon>0$ such that $1-\\beta>A_\\varepsilon q^{-\\varepsilon}$.\nPlugging this result into the blue term of (2), we have\n$$\nx^\\beta\\ll x e^{-A_\\varepsilon q^{-\\varepsilon}\\log x}.\n$$\nIf $q\\le(\\log x)^{2/\\varepsilon}$, then the right hand side becomes $\\ll xe^{-A_\\varepsilon\\sqrt{\\log x}}$. Combining this with (2) gives us the result of Walfisz (1936):\nTheorem 3 (Siegel-Walfisz): For any $M>0$ there exists some $C_M$ such that for all $q\\le(\\log x)^M$ and $(a,q)=1$ there is\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)={x\\over\\varphi(q)}+O\\{e^{-C_M\\sqrt{\\log x}}\\},\\tag3\n$$\nwhere the O-constant is absolute.\nDue to the drawback in the proof of Siegel's theorem, $A_\\varepsilon$ and $C_M$ are not effectively computable.\nImprovements due to Zhang\nHowever, we can significantly obtain a stronger and effective improvement of Siegel-Walfisz theorem if Zhang's result is used. That is\nTheorem 4 (Zhang): There exists $A>0$ and effective $C_1>0$ such that $L(1,\\chi)>C_1(\\log q)^{-A}$.\n\nZhang proved this result for $A=2022$, but I choose not to plug it in for generality.\n\nLet $\\beta$ be the rightmost real zero of $L(s,\\chi)$ for some real $\\chi$ modulo $q$ such that $1-\\beta\\gg(\\log q)^{-1}$. Then it follows from the mean value theorem that there exists some $1-\\beta<\\sigma<1$ such that $1-\\beta=L(1,\\chi)/L'(\\sigma,\\chi)$. Applying the classical bound $L'(\\sigma,\\chi)=O(\\log^2q)$ and Zhang's result gives us the zero-free region that\n$$\n1-\\beta>C_2(\\log q)^{-A-2},\n$$\nwhere $C_2>0$ is effectively computable, which indicates that the blue term in (2) is dominated by\n$$\nx^\\beta\\ll xe^{-C_2(\\log x)(\\log q)^{-A-2}}.\n$$\nIf $(\\log q)^{A+2}\\le\\sqrt{\\log x}$, then the right hand side becomes $\\ll xe^{-C_2\\sqrt{\\log x}}$, which allows Theorem 1 to be improved significantly:\nTheorem 5: Let $A$ be as in Theorem 4. There exists some absolute $c_0>0$ such that for all $q\\le e^{(\\log x)^{1/(2A+4)}}$ and $(a,q)=1$, we have\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)={x\\over\\varphi(q)}+O\\{e^{-c_0\\sqrt{\\log x}}\\}.\\tag4\n$$\nAsymptotic formulas valid for all $q\\ge1$.\nAlthough Theorem 5 is much stronger than Theorem 3, it is difficult to compare them to Theorem 1 without the blue term, so this section is dedicated to deduce asymptotic formula valid for all $q\\ge1$ and $(a,q)=1$ so that a better comparison can be made.\nSince $\\Lambda(n)\\le\\log n$, we know trivially that\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)\\le\\sum_{\\substack{n\\le x\\\\n\\equiv a(q)}}\\log x\\ll{x\\log x\\over q}.\n$$\nCombining this with (3), we see that Theorem 3 indicates that\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)={x\\over\\varphi(q)}+O_N\\{x(\\log x)^{-N}\\}\\quad(N>0).\\tag5\n$$\nIf the trivial upper bound is juxtaposed with (4), then we see that there exists some absolute and effective $c_0>0$ such that\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)={x\\over\\varphi(q)}+O\\{xe^{-c_0(\\log x)^{1/(2A+4)}}\\},\n$$\nwhich has a substantially better error term than (5).", "meta": {"post_id": 433949, "input_score": 137, "output_score": 57, "post_title": "Consequences resulting from Yitang Zhang's latest claimed results on Landau-Siegel zeros"}}
