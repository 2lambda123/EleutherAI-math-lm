What we now need is to figure out the expressions for $r_1(x)$ and $r_2(x)$ and the interval of integration.\n\n$r_1(x)$ is equal to the distance from line $y=1$ to the $x$ -axis. So, $r_1(x)=1}$. $r_2(x)$ is equal to the distance from the curve $y=\\dfrac14x^2$ to the $x$ -axis. So, ${r_2(x)=\\dfrac14x^2}$. Now we can find an expression for the area of the washer's base: $\\begin{aligned} &\\phantom{=} \\pi [(r_1(x)})^2-({r_2(x)})^2] \\\\\\\\ &= \\pi \\left[({1})^2-\\left({\\dfrac14x^2}\\right)^2\\right] \\\\\\\\ &=\\pi \\left( 1-\\dfrac{1}{16}x^4\\right) \\end{aligned}$\n\nThe leftmost endpoint of $R$ is at $x=-2$ and the rightmost endpoint is at $x=2$. So the interval of integration is $[-2,2]$. Now we can express the definite integral in its entirety! $\\int_{-2}^2 \\left[\\pi\\left( 1-\\dfrac{1}{16}x^4\\right)\\right]dx$\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. $\\int_{-2}^2 \\left[\\pi\\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{16}x^4\\right)\\right]dx=\\dfrac{16\\pi}{5}$\n\nIn conclusion, the volume of the solid is $\\dfrac{16\\pi}{5}$.", "meta": {"id": 16086308312, "category": "the-washer-method"}}

Note that losing $10\\%$ is the same as being multiplied by $0.9$. [Why?] This means that the initial quantity is $A=960$ grams and the factor is $B=0.9$. We need to find $f(t)$ based on the fact that the quantity is multiplied by $0.9$ every $871$ years.\n\nFinding the expression in the exponent We know that the mass of the sample is multiplied by $0.9$ every $871$ years. This means that each time $t$ increases by $871$, $f(t)$ increases by $1$. Therefore, $f(t)$ is a linear function whose slope is $\\dfrac{1}{871}$. When the initial measurement is made, the sample has all of its mass remaining. So $M(0) = 960$, which means that $f(0)=0$. [Why?] Therefore, $f(t)$ must be $\\dfrac{t}{871}$.\n\nSummary We found that the following function models the mass of the carbon- $14$ sample remaining $t$ years since the initial measurement. M ( t ) = 960 \u22c5 ( 0.9 ) t 871 M(t)=960\\cdot (0.9)\\^{ \\frac{t}{871}}", "meta": {"id": 16082938143, "category": "construct-exponential-models-according-to-rate-of-change"}}
