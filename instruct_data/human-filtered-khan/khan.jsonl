Then, the volume of each slice is $\\pi[(r_1(x))^2-(r_2(x))^2]\\,dx$, and we can sum the volumes of infinitely many such slices with an infinitely small width using a definite integral: $\\int_a^b \\pi [(r_1(x))^2-(r_2(x))^2]\\,dx$ We call this the washer method. What we now need is to figure out the expressions for $r_1(x)$ and $r_2(x)$ and the interval of integration.\n\n$r_1(x)$ is equal to the distance from line $y=1$ to the $x$ -axis. So, $r_1(x)=1}$. $r_2(x)$ is equal to the distance from the curve $y=\\dfrac14x^2$ to the $x$ -axis. So, ${r_2(x)=\\dfrac14x^2}$. Now we can find an expression for the area of the washer's base: $\\begin{aligned} &\\phantom{=} \\pi [(r_1(x)})^2-({r_2(x)})^2] \\\\\\\\ &= \\pi \\left[({1})^2-\\left({\\dfrac14x^2}\\right)^2\\right] \\\\\\\\ &=\\pi \\left( 1-\\dfrac{1}{16}x^4\\right) \\end{aligned}$\n\nThe leftmost endpoint of $R$ is at $x=-2$ and the rightmost endpoint is at $x=2$. So the interval of integration is $[-2,2]$. Now we can express the definite integral in its entirety! $\\int_{-2}^2 \\left[\\pi\\left( 1-\\dfrac{1}{16}x^4\\right)\\right]dx$\n\nLet's evaluate the integral. $\\int_{-2}^2 \\left[\\pi\\left(1-\\dfrac{1}{16}x^4\\right)\\right]dx=\\dfrac{16\\pi}{5}$\n\nIn conclusion, the volume of the solid is $\\dfrac{16\\pi}{5}$.", "id": 16086308312, "category": "the-washer-method", "openai_response": {"id": "chatcmpl-8mavb8tNrdl6qBRUbA2q1C9bh23rr", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "# Question\nFind the volume of the solid generated when the region $R$ enclosed by the line $y=1$ and the curve $y=\\frac{1}{4}x^2$ is rotated about the $x$-axis.\n\n# Solution\nWe can use the washer method to find the volume of the solid.

At $t=66$, Pluto is at its closest point to the sun, which is $4.4$ billion kilometers away. This corresponds to the minimum point of the graph at $(66,4.4)$.\n\nNext, we determine the amplitude, midline, and period of the function's graph. The midline is at $y=6.9$, so the midline is $d=6.9$. The minimum point is $2.5$ units below the midline, so the amplitude is $|a|=2.5$. The period is the distance between consecutive minimum points, which is $66$ years. Therefore, the period is $4\\cdot 66=264$ years.\n\nSince the midline intersection at $t=0$ is followed by a minimum point, we know that $a<0$. Therefore, $a=-2.5$. The period is $264$ years, so $b=\\frac{2\\pi}{264}=\\frac{\\pi}{132}$.\n\nThus, the sinusoidal expression for Pluto's distance from the sun is given by $P(t)=-2.5\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{132}t\\right)+6.9$."}

Thus, the equation of the perpendicular line will be of the form $y = -3x + b$.\n\nWe can plug the point $(-3, 6)$ into this equation to solve for $b$, the y-intercept:\n$$6 = -3(-3) + b$$\n$$6 = 9 + b$$\n$$b = -3$$\n\nSo, the equation of the perpendicular line is $y = -3x - 3$. \n\nThe two lines intersect at the point $(0, -3)$. Thus, the distance we're looking for is the distance between the two points.\n\nUsing the distance formula, the distance between the points $(-3, 6)$ and $(0, -3)$ is:\n$$\\sqrt{(-3 - 0)^2 + (6 - (-3))^2}$$\n$$= \\sqrt{(-3)^2 + (9)^2}$$\n$$= \\sqrt{90}$$\n$$= 3\\sqrt{10}$$\n\nTherefore, the distance between the point $(-3, 6)$ and the line $y = \\dfrac{1}{3}x - 3$ is $3\\sqrt{10}$."}

Both sine and cosine can be used to model periodic contexts. We can decide which is better fitting by considering the $y$ -intercept. The sine function intercepts the $y$ -axis at its midline, and the cosine function intercepts the $y$ -axis at its peak. That way, we know Pluto achieved its minimum distance in $1989$, when $u = 0$. Since $\\cos u$ reaches a peak at $0$, we'll use a cosine function to model this situation.
