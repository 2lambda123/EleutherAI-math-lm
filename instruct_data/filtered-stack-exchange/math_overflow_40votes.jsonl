{"input": "Do the Witt vectors satisfy a universal property?", "output": "As Morten Brun said, the big Witt vector functor is the right adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of lambda-rings to the category of rings (commutative). But this answer is not completely satisfying in that Witt vectors usually come up in number theory, in contexts that have little direct connection to K-theory. It's also not clear what the analogue of that statement for the $p$-typical Witt vectors is. ($p$ is a prime here. The $p$-typical Witt vectors are the usual \"non-big\" Witt vectors as defined by Witt and which come up in the theory of local fields, for instance.)\nTo me, the most satisfying answer to this question is that Witt $W(A)$ gives the universal way of equipping your ring $A$ with lifts of Frobenius maps. For simplicity, let's look at the $p$-typical Witt vectors. Then $W(A)$ has a ring endomorphism $F$ which is congruent to the $p$-th power map modulo the ideal $pW(A)$. In other words, $W(A)$ has a lift of the Frobenius endomorphism of $W(A)/pW(A)$. There is also a ring map $W(A) \\rightarrow A$ given by projection on the the first component.\nNow, in what sense is $W(A)$ universal? Suppose $B$ is another ring equipped with a ring map $B \\rightarrow A$ and an endomorphism $F:B \\rightarrow B$ lifting the Frobenius endomorphism of $B/pB$. Then, assuming $B$ is $p$-torsionfree, there exists a unique ring map $B \\rightarrow W(A)$ commuting with the two maps $F$ and the two maps to $A$. (This is a theorem called \"Cartier's Dieudonne-Dwork lemma\" in classical exposition of the Witt vectors, but is essentially true by definition in some more recent ones.) Thus, ignoring the issue of $p$-torsion, $W(A)$ is the universal ring mapping to $A$ with a Frobenius lift.\nHow do we deal with torsion? First, if $A$ itself is $p$-torsion free, then so is $W(A)$ - it is actually a subring of an infinite product of copies of $A$. So then $W$ is the right adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of $p$-torsionfree rings equipped with a Frobenius lift to the category of $p$-torsionfree rings. Now it will one day be clear that the most important uses of $W(A)$ are when $A$ is torsion free, but certainly the most important existing applications are when $A$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra, where everything is $p$-torsion. So it would be nice to have a universal property that works whether there is $p$-torsion or not.\nProbably the most straightforward way to do this is to use a better definition of \"Frobenius lift\". If $F$ is a Frobenius lift on $B$ as above and $B$ is $p$-torsion free, then $d(x)=(F(x)-x^p)/p$ is a well-defined operator on $B$. The condition that $F$ be a ring endomorphism can be of course be expressed in terms of slightly complicated identities on $d$. The key point, then, is that by the magical properties of binomial coefficients modulo $p$, these identities have integral coefficients -- there are no $p$'s in the denominators! Then we can define a $d$-ring structure on any ring to be an operator $d$ satisfying these conditions. Then you can show by reduction to the $p$-torsion-free case that $W$ is the right adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of $d$-rings to the category of rings. The point of all this is to eliminate the existential quantifier hidden in the word \"lift\" by specifying a $y$ such that $F(x)-x^p$ is $p$ times $y$, rather than just saying some such element $y$ exists.\nPretty much everything is the same when dealing with more than one prime, except that the Frobenius lifts are required to commute. The big Witt vectors are what you get when you have commuting Frobenius lifts at all primes.\nI think this point of view was first discovered by Joyal. You can also see the first section of my paper \"Basic geometry of Witt vectors\", which is on the archive. Unlike mine, Joyal's papers on this are wonderfully short.

To me, Koszul duality is a fundamental homological phenomenon which has many manifestations, e.g.\n\nthe relation between the homotopy groups of a topological space and its (co)homology groups;\nthe relation between an augmented algebra A and its Ext-algebra $\\text{Ext}_{A}(k,k)$ (and between modules over these);\nthe relation between the ring of differential operators and the de Rham DG-algebra of differential forms (and between modules over these).\n\nVersion 1. is obviously complicated and one can approach it from various angles, like rational homotopy theory or stable homotopy theory.  The former is related to the duality between commutative and Lie DG-algebras (Quillen), while the latter is more akin to module duality, in that it is additive.  Morphisms from the sphere spectrum to the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum are very simple to describe, while endomorphisms of the latter spectrum are more complicated and endomorphisms of the former one are much more complicated.  One can view the sphere spectrum as a kind of projective generator and the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum as a kind of irreducible module.\nVersion 2. is better to approach by splitting it in two branches, namely\n2a. the relation between a conilpotent coalgebra $C$ and its Ext-algebra $\\text{Ext}_{C}(k,k)$; and\n2b. the relation between an augmented algebra $A$ and its Tor-coalgebra $\\text{Tor}^{A}(k,k)$.  Then one can generalize 2a. to DG-coalgebras, and 2b. to DG-algebras, which makes these two correspondences inverse to each other.  Subsequently one can notice that the augmentation assumption or structure is largely irrelevant for 2b., and generalize this duality even further, obtaining a correspondence between conilpotent CDG- (curved DG-) coalgebras and (nonaugmented) DG-algebras.\nVersion 3. is a relative one, with the ring of functions playing the role of the basic field.  The functions are not central in the differential operators and the de Rham differential is not linear over the functions, which makes such a relativization of Koszul duality highly nontrivial and interesting.\nWith both 2. and 3., there is a major problem that the duality functors do not preserve acyclicity of complexes.  For example, a nonacyclic DG-algebra is sometimes assigned to an acyclic DG-coalgebra, and a nonacyclic complex of D-modules is assigned to an acyclic DG-module over the de Rham complex.  And for curved DG-structures, the notion of quasi-isomorphism does not even make sense.  The general solution is that one has to introduce an equivalence relation more delicate than quasi-isomorphism, particularly on the coalgebra side of the story.  The relevant references include Hinich's paper, Lefevre-Hasegawa's thesis and Keller's exposition of some results contained therein, and my recent preprint, which is supposed to contain state of the art.

(At this point, however, I would strongly prefer a good intuitive explanation to a rigorous description of the modern theory.  It would also be nice to get some picture of the historical development of the subject.)\nSome sub-questions: what does the condition that d^2 = 0 means on an intuitive level?  What's the intuition behind the definition of the boundary operator in simplicial homology?  In what sense does homology count holes?  What does this geometric picture have to do with group extensions?

A warning: the idea by itself does not define homology, but something much scarier. Homology is what you get when you give up studying the scary but intuitive thing, and try to get something similar, but which you can calculate.\nConsider a manifold. Homology is meant to count its submanifolds, up to cobordism. In other words, as out \"chains of dimension $n$\", take the formal sums of submanifolds of dimension $n$, where the submanifolds might have boundary. The boundary operation $\\partial$ just takes the boundary. Notice that the boundary of any manifold is a manifold without boundary, so it's clear that $\\partial^2=0$.\nNow, the homology of this chain complex counts submanifolds without boundary; two submanifolds are considered different if they are not boundaries of the same higher-dimensional submanifold. If you think of the higher-dimensional submanifolds as a way to \"move\" one of the submanifolds to another, it makes sense that you might want to think of them as the \"same\". If a submanifold does not surround a \"hole\", it is the \"same\" as the \"empty submanifold\", this is a sense in which this homology counts holes.\n\nAgain, if you try to make this precise, you will run into all kinds of trouble. You'll have to define what a \"submanifold\" is, whether they can have self-intersections, etc. Then, you'll find that the above kind of \"homology\" is not really a homotopy invariant, and terribly difficult to calculate.\nHowever, you should compare the above idea to the definition of simplicial homology. You'll see that the cycles you get in simplicial homology are similar to submanifolds, and all the wonderful algebraic machinery will show you that you can actually calculate homology of anything you'd like.\nOne algebraic topology book that seems to have this approach in it is Bredon's \"Topology and Geometry\".\nThe above intuition is especially useful in differential topology. There is a way to make the above idea (called cobordism theory), but you need to know how to use homology to do it. For a taste of it (that doesn't require homology), look in the last chapter of Milnor's \"Topology from the Differential Viewpoint\".\n\nThree unrelated comments: \n\nNever expect any intuition from singular (co)homology, and never calculate anything with it; it is merely a tool for showing that other kinds of homology (that you actually care about) are the same and invariant under homotopy.\nA completely different (and very precise) way to intuitively think of cohomology is as solutions to a certain differential equation. This is the approach of the \"Calculus to Cohomology\" book and Bott and Tu's \"Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology\", and is called De Rham cohomology.\nDon't be surprised if there are some mistakes in any of the above; wise people - feel free to point them out and clarify!", "meta": {"post_id": 640, "input_score": 99, "output_score": 59, "post_title": "What is (co)homology, and how does a beginner gain intuition about it?"}}

The conductor mesures the ramification of the Galois group of the local field on the Tate module of the elliptic curves. The formal definition is given in Serre's book as said Jordan, in Buhler's text in the link given by Rob, and also in Sliverman's second volume on elliptic curves. \nThe conductor is a non-negative integer involved in the $L$-function of $E$. Its $p$-part $f_p$ vanishes iff the Tate module is unramified (the inertia group of ${\\mathbb Q}_p$ acts trivially). Otherwise it has two part, a tame one, which depends solely on the reduction type of the N\u00e9ron model of $E$ (I think this is proved in Serre-Tate's paper ''Good reduction of Abelian varieties''). \nThe second part (the wild one) in the conductor is the Swan conductor. It is the most headhach one. It vanishes if and only if the $p$-Sylow acts trivially on the Tate module. In very simple cases, it can be computed directly. In general, it is related to the invariants of $E$ given by Tate's algorithm: the conductor $f_p$ is given by Ogg's formula:\n$$ f_p=\\nu_p(\\Delta) - n +1 $$\nwhere $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of a minimal Weierstrass equation of $E$, and $n$ is the number of geometric irreducible components of the fiber at $p$ of the minimal regular projective model of $E$ over $\\mathbb Z$ (the fiber at $p$ is a projective, possibly reducible curve over $\\mathbb F_p$, when $n$ is computed over the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb F_p$). In Buhler's text, ''geometric'' is missing. \nTate's algorithm gives $\\Delta$ and $n$ and computer can find them very quickly. So everybody is happy. \nBut, Ogg's formula, stated in his late 60's paper, was not fully proved. He checked the equality by case by case analysis. In residue characteristic 2, he said ''for the sake of simplicity, we will work in equal characteristic'' ! We know that equal characteristic is kind of limit of mixed characteristic (when the absolute ramification index tends to infinity), of course, this hypothesis simplifies a lot the computation, but does not give any crew for the mixed characteristic case (e.g. $\\mathbb Q_p$). While this formula was widely used in computer programs, and often used as a definition of the conductor (!), some people were awared of the incompleteness of the proof. For example, Serre said this in seminars. This was also pointed out in the paper of Lockhart, Rosen and Silverman bounding conductor of abelian varieties (J. Alg. Geometry).  \nThis situation is repaired in 1988 in a magistral paper of Takeshi Saito. Let $R$ be a d.v.r. with perfect residue field, let $C$ be a projective smooth and geometrically connected curve of positive genus over the field of fractions of $R$ and let $X$ be the minimal regular projective model of $C$ over $R$. One defines the Artin conductor ${\\rm Art}(X/R)$ which turns out to be $f+n-1$ with the same meaning as above ($f$ is the conductor associated to the Jacobian of $C$). Saito proved that \n$${\\rm Art}(X/R)=\\nu(\\Delta)$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\in R$ is the ''discriminant'' of $X$ which mesures the defect of a functorial isomorphism which involves powers of the relative dualizing sheaf of $X/R$. When $C$ is an elliptic curve, one can prove that $\\Delta$ is actually the discriminant of a minimal Weierstrass equation over $R$, and le tour est jou\u00e9 !

This is why you get (if you're over an alg closed field) that having a faithful fiber functor to Vect_k means you're sheaves on the quotient BG of a point by some group G, i.e. Rep G..

{"input": "I find Wikipedia's discussion of symbols of differential operators a bit impenetrable, and Google doesn't seem to turn up useful links, so I'm hoping someone can point me to a more pedantic discussion.\nBackground\nI think I understand the basic idea on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so for readers who know as little as I do, I will provide some ideas.  Any differential operator on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is (uniquely) of the form $\\sum p_{i_1,\\dotsc,i_k}(x)\\frac{\\partial^k}{\\partial x_{i_1}\\dots\\partial x_{i_k}}$, where $x_1,\\dotsc,x_n$ are the canonical coordinate functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the $p_{i_1,\\dotsc,i_k}(x)$ are smooth functions, and the sum ranges over (finitely many) possible indexes (of varying length).  Then the symbol of such an operator is $\\sum p_{i_1,\\dotsc,i_k}(x)\\xi^{i_1}\\dotso\\xi^{i_k}$, where $\\xi^1,\\dotsc,\\xi^n$ are new variables; the symbol is a polynomial in the variables $\\{\\xi^1,\\dotsc,\\xi^n\\}$ with coefficients in the algebra of smooth functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nOk, great.  So symbols are well-defined for $\\mathbb{R}^n$.  But most spaces are not $\\mathbb{R}^n$ \u2014 most spaces are formed by gluing together copies of (open sets in) $\\mathbb{R}^n$ along smooth maps.  So what happens to symbols under changes of coordinates?  An affine change of coordinates is a map $y_j(x)=a_j+\\sum_jY_j^ix_i$ for some vector $(a_1,\\dotsc,a_n)$ and some invertible matrix $Y$.  It's straightforward to describe how the differential operators change under such a transformation, and thus how their symbols transform.  In fact, you can forget about the fact that indices range $1,\\dotsc,n$, and think of them as keeping track of tensor contraction; then everything transforms as tensors under affine coordinate changes, e.g. the variables $\\xi^i$ transform as coordinates on the cotangent bundle.\nOn the other hand, consider the operator $D = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ on $\\mathbb{R}$, with symbol $\\xi^2$; and consider the change of coordinates $y = f(x)$.  By the chain rule, the operator $D$ transforms to $(f'(y))^2\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + f''(y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}$, with symbol $(f'(y))^2\\psi^2 + f''(y)\\psi$.  In particular, the symbol did not transform as a function on the cotangent space.  Which is to say that I don't actually understand where the symbol of a differential operator lives in a coordinate-free way.\nWhy I care\nOne reason I care is because I'm interested in quantum mechanics.  If the symbol of a differential operator on a space $X$ were canonically a function on the cotangent space $T^\\ast X$, then the inverse of this Symbol map would determine a \"quantization\" of the functions on $T^\\ast X$, corresponding to the QP quantization of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nBut the main reason I was thinking about this is from Lie algebras.  I'd like to understand the following proof of the PBW theorem:\n\nLet $L$ be a Lie algebra over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, $G$ a group integrating the Lie algebra, $\\mathrm{U}L$ the universal enveloping algebra of $L$ and $\\mathrm{S}L$ the symmetric algebra of the vector space $L$.  Then $\\mathrm{U}L$ is naturally the space of left-invariant differential operators on $G$, and $\\mathrm{S}L$ is naturally the space of symbols of left-invariant differential operators on $G$.  Thus the map Symbol defines a canonical vector-space (and in fact coalgebra) isomorphism $\\mathrm{U}L\\to\\mathrm{S}L$.", "output": "One way to understand the symbol of a differential operator (or more generally, a pseudodifferential operator) is to see what the operator does to \"wave packets\" - functions that are strongly localised in both space and frequency.\nSuppose, for instance, that one is working in $\\mathbb R^n$, and one takes a function $\\psi$ which is localised to a small neighbourhood of a point $x_0$, and whose Fourier transform is localised to a small neighbourhood of $\\xi_0/\\hbar$, for some frequency $\\xi_0$ (or more geometrically, think of $(x_0,\\xi_0)$ as an element of the cotangent bundle of $\\mathbb R^n$).

Then there's a natural equivalence of categories from the derived category of coherent sheaves on the stack of $G$-local systems to the derived category of coherent $\\mathcal{D}$-modules on the moduli stack of principal $^L G$-bundles, such that the structure sheaf of a point is sent to a Hecke Eigensheaf (and I'm not going to sit down and define that on top of the rest here...the idea is that $G$-local systems on the curve are equivalent to eigensheaves for some collection of operators, but actually making it precise and having a hope of being true gets technical)\nEdit 2: This paper states one version of the conjecture (for $GL(n)$ only) as 1.3, after defining the Hecke operators.", "output": "OK, this is a very broad question so I'll be telegraphic.\nThere is a sequence of increasingly detailed conjectures going by the name GL -- it's really a \"program\" (harmonic analysis of $\\mathcal{D}$-modules on moduli of bundles) rather than a conjecture -- and only the first of this sequence has been proved (and only for $GL_n$), but I don't want to get into this.\nThere are several kinds of reasons you might want to study geometric Langlands:\n\ndirect consequences. One application is Gaitsgory's proof of de Jong's conjecture (arXiv:math/0402184). If you prove the ramified geometric Langlands for $GL_n$, you will recover L. Lafforgue's results (Langlands for function fields), which have lots of consequences (enumerated eg I think in his Fields medal description), which I won't enumerate. (well really you'd need to prove them \"well\" to get the motivic consequences..)\nIn fact you'll recover much more (like independence of $l$ results). To me though this is the least convincing motivation..\nOriginal motivation: by understanding the function field version of Langlands you can hope to learn a lot about the Langlands program, working in a much easier setting where you have a chance to go much further. In particular the GLP (the version over $\\mathbb{C}$) has a LOT more structure than the Langlands program -- ie things are MUCH nicer, there are much stronger and cleaner results you can hope to prove, and hope to use this to gain insight into underlying patterns.\n\nBy far the greatest example of this is Ngo's proof of the Fundamental Lemma --- he doesn't use GLP per se, but rather the geometry of the Hitchin system, which is one of the key geometric ingredients discovered through the GLP. To me this already makes the whole endeavor worthwhile..\n\nRelations with physics. Once you're over $\\mathbb{C}$, you (by which I mean Beilinson-Drinfeld and Kapustin-Witten) discover lots of deep relations with (at least seemingly) different problems in physics. \n\na. The first is the theory of integrable systems -- many classical integrable systems fit into the Hitchin system framework, and geometric Langlands gives you a very powerful tool to study the corresponding quantum integrable systems. In fact you (namely BD) can motivate the entire GLP as a way to fully solve a collection of quantum integrable systems. This has has lots of applications in the subject (eg see Frenkel's reviews on the Gaudin system, papers on Calogero-Moser systems etc).\nb. The second is conformal field theory (again BD) --- they develop CFT (conformal, not class, field theory!) very far towards the goal of understanding GLP, leading to deep insights in both directions (and a strategy now by Gaitsgory-Lurie to solve the strongest form of GLP).\nc. The third is four-dimensional gauge theory (KW). To me the best way to motivate geometric Langlands is as an aspect of electric-magnetic duality in 4d SUSY gauge theory. This ties \nin GLP to many of the hottest current topics in string theory/gauge theory (including Dijkgraaf-Vafa theory, wall crossing/Donaldson-Thomas theory, study of M5 branes, yadda yadda yadda)...\n\nFinally GLP is deeply tied to a host of questions in representation theory, of loop algebras, quantum groups, algebraic groups over finite fields etc. The amazing work of Bezrukavnikov proving a host of fundamental conjectures of Lusztig is based on GLP ideas (and can be thought of as part of the local GLP). (my personal research program with Nadler is to use the same ideas to understand reps of real semisimple Lie groups). This kind of motivation is secretly behind much of the work of BD --- the starting point for all of it is the Beilinson-Bernstein description of reps as $\\mathcal{D}$-modules.\n\nThere's more but this is already turning into a blog post so I should stop.", "meta": {"post_id": 4180, "input_score": 45, "output_score": 61, "post_title": "Consequences of Geometric Langlands"}}
{"input": "I've been prodded to ask a question expanding this one on Ramanujan's constant $R=\\exp(\\pi\\sqrt{163})$.\nRecall that $R$ is very close to an integer; specifically $R=262537412640768744 - \\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is about $0.75 \\times 10^{-12}$.  Call the integer here $N$, so $R = N - \\epsilon$.\nSo $R^2 = N^2 - 2N\\epsilon + \\epsilon^2$.  It turns out that $N\\epsilon$ is itself nearly an integer, namely $196884$, and so $R^2$ is again an almost-integer.  More precisely,\n$$j(\\tau) = 1/q + 744 + 196884q + 21493760q^2 + O(q^3)$$\nwhere $q = \\exp(2\\pi i\\tau)$.   For $\\tau = (1+\\sqrt{-163})/2$, and hence $q = \\exp(-\\pi\\sqrt{163})$, it's known that the left-hand side is an integer.  Squaring both sides,\n$$j(\\tau)^2 = 1/q^2 + 1488/q + 974304 + 335950912q + O(q^2).$$\nTo show that $1/q^2$ is nearly an integer, we can rearrange a bit to get\n$$j(\\tau)^2 - 1/q^2 - 974304 = 1488/q + 335950912q + O(q^2)$$\nand we want the left-hand side to be nearly zero.  $1488/q$ is nearly an integer since $1/q$ is nearly an integer; since q is small the higher-order terms on the right-hand side are small.  \nAs noted by Mark Thomas in this question, $R^5$ is also very close to an integer -- but as I pointed out, that integer is not $N^5$.  This isn't special to fifth powers.  $R$, $R^2$, $R^3$, $R^4$, $R^5$, $R^6$, respectively differ from the nearest integer by less than $10^{-12}$, $10^{-9}$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-6}$, $10^{-5}$, $10^{-4}$, and $10^{-2}$.  But the method of proof outlined above doesn't work for higher powers, since the coefficients of the $q$-expansion of $j(\\tau)^5$ (for example) grow too quickly.  Is there some explanation for the fact that these higher powers are almost integers?", "output": "Another take on this:\nAs David Speyer and FC's answer shows, this question can be answered without any additional deep theory.\nHowever, I'd like to explain a variant on their arguments that puts this in a little more context regarding modular forms.   It also means we can use a technique which makes it easier to see how good these approximations are in terms of the growth rate of the coeffients of the j-function.\nThe important fact here is that any modular function (for SL_2(Z)) with integer coefficients in its q-expansion takes on integer values at \u03c4 = (1+\u221a(-163))/2 (and so q = exp(-\u03c0\u221a163)).  This fact is in fact a consequence of the integrality of the j-value here, since any such function can be expressed as a polynomial in j with integer coefficients (although similar things are true in other contexts, such as modular functions of higher level, where there is not a canonical generator for the ring of such modular invariants).\nThis means that, just as we can use the integrality of\n$j(\\tau) = q^{-1} + 744 + O(q) $\nto get an integer approximation to $q^{-1}$, if we have a modular function $f_n$ with power series of the form\n$f_n(\\tau) = q^{-n} + integer + O(q)$,\nwe can get an integer approximation to $q^{-n}$.  How good this approximation is will depend upon the size of the coefficients of the power series for the $O(q)$ part.\nFortunately for us, such a function $f_n$ always exists (and is unique up to adding integer constants).  How can we construct it?  One way is to take an appropriate polynomial in $j$, that is, take an appropriate linear combination of $j, j^2, \\cdots , j^n$ to get a function with the right principal part.  This clearly works, and if one works out the details, it should turn out equivalent to FC's and David's approach.\nHowever, now that we're in the modular forms mindset, we have other tools at our disposal.  In particular, another way to create new modular functions is to apply Hecke operators to existing modular functions, such as $j$.  This turns out to be an effective way to get modular functions of the type we need, since Hecke operators do predictable things to principal parts of q-series (for example, if $p$ is prime, $T_p j = q^{-p} + O(1)$).  I'll just explain how this works for $n = 5$, although the method should generalize immediately to any prime $n$ (composite $n$ might be a little trickier, but not much).\nThe theory of Hecke operators tells us that the function $T_5 j$ defined by\n$$(T_5 j)(z) = j(5 z) + \\sum_{i \\ mod \\ 5} j (\\frac{z + i}{5})$$\nis modular, with q-expansion given by\n$$(T_5 j)(\\tau) = q^{-5} + \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} (5 c_{5n} + c_{n/5}) q^n$$.\nwhere the $c_n$ are the coefficients in\n$$j(\\tau) = q^{-1} + \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} c_n q^n$$\n(and $c_n = 0$ if $n$ is not an integer).\nSo if as before we set $q = e^{- \\pi \\sqrt{163}}$, we find that\n$q^{-5} + 6 c_0 + 5 c_5 q + 5 c_{10} q^2 + 5 c_{15} q^3 + 5 c_{20} q^4 + (c_1 + 5 c_{25}) q^5 + \\dots$\nis an integer.\nNow, $q$ is roughly $4 \\cdot 10^{-18}$, and looking up the coefficients for $j(z)$ on OEIS, we find that\n$q^{-5} + 6 \\cdot 744 + 5 \\cdot (\\sim 3\\cdot 10^{11}) (\\sim 4\\cdot10^{-18})  + \\text{clearly smaller terms}$\nis an integer.  Hence $q^{-5}$ should be off from an integer by roughly $6 \\cdot 10^{-6}$.

{"input": "I know (at least I think I know) that some of the main motivating problems in the development of etale cohomology were the Weil conjectures.  I'd like to know what other problems one can solve using the machinery of etale cohomology.  I know a little bit about how etale cohomology groups appear in algebraic number theory but I'd like to know about ways that these things show up in other mathematical subjects as well.  Is there anything that an algebraic topologist should really know about etale cohomology?  What about a differential geometer?", "output": "$\\DeclareMathOperator{\\gal}{Gal}$\nHere's a comment which one can make to differential geometers which at least explains what etale cohomology \"does\". Given an algebraic variety over the reals, say a smooth one, its complex points are a complex manifold but with a little extra structure: the complex points admit an automorphism coming from complex conjugation. Hence the singular cohomology groups inherit an induced automorphism, which is extra information that is sometimes worth carrying around. In short: the cohomology of an algebraic variety defined over the reals inherits an action of $\\gal(\\mathbb{C}/\\mathbb{R})$.\nThe great thing about etale cohomology is that a number theorist can now do the same trick with algebraic varieties defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The etale cohomology groups of this variety will have the same dimension as the singular cohomology groups (and are indeed isomorphic to them via a comparison theorem, once the coefficient ring is big enough) but the advantage is that that they inherit a structure of the amazingly rich and complicated group $\\gal(\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})$. I've often found that this comment sees off differential geometers, with the thought \"well at least I sort-of know the point of it now\". A differential geometer probably doesn't want to study $\\gal(\\bar{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q})$ though.\nIf I put my Langlands-philosophy hat on though, I can see a huge motivation for etale cohomology: Langlands says that automorphic forms should give rise to representations of Galois groups, and etale cohomology is a very powerful machine for constructing representations of Galois groups, so that's why I might be interested in it even if I'm not an algebraic geometer.\nFinally, I guess a much simpler motivating good reason for etale cohomology is that geometry is definitely facilitated when you have cohomology theories around. That much is clear. But if you're doing algebraic geometry over a field that isn't $\\mathbb C$ or $\\mathbb R$ then classical cohomology theories aren't going to cut it, and the Zariski topology is so awful that you can't use it alone to do geometry---you're going to need some help. Hence etale cohomology, which gives the right answers: e.g. a smooth projective curve over any field has a genus, and etale cohomology is a theory which assigns to it an $H^1$ of dimension $2g$ (<pedant> at least if you use $\\ell$-adic cohomology for $\\ell$ not zero in the field <\\pedant>).", "meta": {"post_id": 6070, "input_score": 85, "output_score": 120, "post_title": "Etale cohomology -- Why study it?"}}

If anyone has another take on this action, that would be interesting to hear about.\nApparently they also relate to the geometric Langlands program, which is what really prompts my post; can anyone elaborate on this?", "output": "Well the first thing to say is to look at the very enthusiastic and world-encompassing papers of Cherednik himself on DAHA as the center of the mathematical world (say his 1998 ICM). \nI'll mention a couple of more geometric aspects, but this is a huuuge area..\nThere are at least three distinct geometric appearances of DAHA, which you could classify by the number of loops (as in loop groups) that appear - two, one or zero.\n(BTW for those in the know I will mostly intentionally ignore the difference between DAHA and its spherical subalgebra.)\nDouble loop picture: See e.g. Kapranov's paper arXiv:math/9812021 (notes for lectures of his on it available on my webpage) and the related arXiv:math/0012155. The intuitive idea, very hard to make precise, is that DAHA is the double loop (or 2d local field, such as F_q((s,t)) ) analog of the finite (F_q) and affine (F_q((s)) ) Hecke algebras. In other words it appears as functions on double cosets for the double loop group and its \"Borel\" subalgebra. (Of course you need to decide what \"functions\" or rather \"measures\" means and what \"Borel\" means..)  This means in particular it controls principal series type reps of double loop groups, or the geometry of moduli of G-bundles on a surface, looked at near a \"flag\" (meaning a point inside a curve inside the surface). The rep theory over 2d local fields that you would need to have for this to make sense is studied in a series of papers of Kazhdan with Gaitsgory (arXiv:math/0302174, 0406282, 0409543), with Braverman (0510538) and most recently with Hrushovski (0510133 and 0609115). The latter is totally awesome IMHO, using ideas from logic to define definitively what measure theory on such local fields means.\nSingle loop picture: Affine Hecke algebras have two presentations, the \"standard\" one (having to do with abstract Kac-Moody groups) and the Bernstein one (having to do specifically with loop groups). These two appear on the two sides of Langlands duality (cf eg the intro to the book of Chriss and Ginzburg). Likewise there's a picture of DAHA that's dual to the above \"standard\" one. This is developed first in Garland-Grojnowski (arXiv:q-alg/9508019) and more thoroughly by Vasserot arXiv:math/0207127 and several papers of Varagnolo-Vasserot. The idea here is that DAHA appears as the K-group of coherent sheaves on G(O)\\G(K)/G(O) - the loop group version of the Bruhat cells in the finite flag manifold (again ignoring Borels vs parabolics). Again this is hard to make very precise. This gives in particular a geometric picture for the reps of DAHA, analogous to that for AHA due to Kazhdan-Lusztig (see again Chriss-Ginzburg). \n[EDIT: A\nnew survey on this topic by Varagnolo-Vasserot has just appeared.]\nHere is where geometric Langlands comes in: the above interp means that DAHA is the Hecke algebra that acts on (K-groups of) coherent sheaves on T^* Bun_G X for any Riemann surface X -- it's the coherent analog of the usual Hecke operators in geometric Langlands.\nThus if you categorify DAHA (look at CATEGORIES of coherent sheaves) you get the Hecke functors for the so-called \"classical limit of Langlands\" (cotangent to Bun_G is the classical limit of diffops on Bun_G).\nThe Cherednik Fourier transform gives an identification between DAHA for G and the dual group G'. In this picture it is an isom between K-groups of coherent sheaves on Grassmannians for Langlands dual groups (the categorified version of this is conjectured in Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Mirkovic arXiv:math/0306413). This is a natural part of the classical limit of Langlands: you're supposed to have an equivalence between coherent sheaves on cotangents of Langlands dual Bun_G's, and this is its local form, identifying the Hecke operators on the two sides!\nIn this picture DAHA appears recently in physics (since geometric Langlands in all its variants does), in the work of Kapustin (arXiv:hep-th/0612119 and with Saulina 0710.2097) as \"Wilson-'t Hooft operators\" --- the idea is that in SUSY gauge theory there's a full DAHA of operators (with the above names). Passing to the TFT which gives Langlands kills half of them - a different half on the two sides of Langlands duality, hence the asymmetry.. but in the classical version all the operators survive, and the SL2Z of electric-magnetic/Montonen-Olive S-duality is exactly the Cherednik SL2Z you mention..\nFinally (since this is getting awfully long), the no-loop picture: this is the one you referred to in 2. via Dunkl type operators. Namely DAHA appears as difference operators on H/W (and its various degenerations, the Cherednik algebras, appear by replacing H by h and difference by differential). In this guise (and I'm not giving a million refs to papers of Etingof and many others since you know them better) DAHA is the symmetries of quantum many-body systems (Calogero-Moser and Ruijsenaars-Schneiders systems to be exact), and this is where Macdonald polynomials naturally appear as the quantum integrals of motion.\nThe only thing I'll say here is point to some awesome recent work of Schiffmann and Vasserot arXiv:0905.2555, where this picture too is tied to geometric Langlands..\nvery very roughly the idea is that H/W is itself (a degenerate version of an open piece of) a moduli of G-bundles, in the case of an elliptic curve. Thus studying DAHA is essentially studying D-modules or difference modules on Bun_G in genus one (see Nevins' paper arXiv:0804.4170 where such ideas are developed further).

This is best thought of as a quantized version of jets of functions on the Poisson dual group.  It's most important characteristic is that it has a very large central Hopf subalgebre (generated by the lth powers of the standard generators).  In particular, its representation theory is sits over Spec of the large center, which is necessarily a group and turns out to be the Poisson dual group.  It also has a small quotient Hopf algebra when you kill the large center.\nThe main sources for the structure of the finite dimensional representations are papers by subsets of Kac-DeConcini-Procesi (the structure of the representations depends on the symplectic leaf in G*, in particular there are \"generic\" ones coming from the big cell) as well as some more recent work by Kremnitzer (proving some stronger results about the dimensions of the non-generic representations) and by DeConcini-Procesi-Reshetikhin-Rosso (giving the tensor product rules for generic reps).  The main application that I know of this integral form is to invariants of knots together with a hyperbolic structure on the compliment and to invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds due to Kashaev, Baseilhac-Bennedetti, and Kashaev-Reshetikhin.  The hope is that these invariants will shed some light on the volume conjecture.\nThe Lusztig form:\nHere you start with the integral form that has divided powers.  Structurally this has a small subalgebra generated by the usual generators (E_i, F_i, K_i)  since E^l = 0.  The quotient by this subalgebra gives the usual universal enveloping algebra via something called the quantum Frobenius map.  The main representation that people look at are the \"tilting modules.\"  Tilting modules have a technical description, but the important point is that the indecomposable tilting modules are exactly the summands of the tensor products of the fundamental representations.  Indecomposable tilting modules are indexed by weights in the Weyl chamber.  The \"linkage principle\" tells you that inside the decomposition series of a given indecomposable tilting module you only need to look at the Weyl modules with highest weights given by smaller elements in a certain affine Weyl group orbit.\nIt is the Lusztig integral form (not specialized) that is important for categorification.  The Lusztig form at a root of unity is important for relationships between quantum groups and representations of algebraic groups and for relationships to affine lie algebras.  The main sources are Lusztig and HH Andersen (and his colaborators).  I'm also fond of a paper of Sawin's that does a very nice job cleaning up the literature.\nThe Lusztig integral form is also the natural one from a quantum topology point of view.  For example, if you start with the Temperley-Lieb algebra (or equivalently, tangles modulo the Kauffman bracket relations) and specialize q to a root of unity what you end up with is the planar algebra for the tilting modules for the Lusztig form at that root of unity.\nThe small quantum group:\nThis is a finite dimensional Hopf algebra, it appears as a quotient of the K-DC form (quotienting by the large central subalgebra) and as a subalgebra of the Lusztig form (generated by the standard generators).  I gather that the representation theory is not very well understood.  But there has been some work recently by Roman Bezrukavnikov and others.  I also wrote a blog post on what the representation theory looks like here for one of the smallest examples.\nThe semisimplified category:\nUnlike the other examples, this is not the category of representations of a Hopf algebra!  (Although like all fusion categories it is the category of representations of a weak Hopf algebra.)  You start with either the category of tilting modules for the Lusztig form or the category of finite dimensional representations of the small quantum group and then you \"semisimplify\" by killing all \"negligible morphisms.\"  A morphism is negligible if it gives you 0 no matter how you \"close it off.\" Alternately the negligible morphisms are the kernel of a certain inner product on the Hom spaces.  The resulting category is semisimple, its representation theory is a \"truncated\" version of the usual representation theory.  In particular the only surviving representations are those in the \"Weyl alcove\" which is like the Weyl chamber except its been cut off by a line perpendicular to l times a certain fundamental weight (see Sawin's paper for the correct line which depends subtly on the kind of root of unity).\nThis example is the main source of modular categories and of interesting fusion categories.  Its main application is the 3-manifold invariants of Reshetikhin-Turaev (where this quotient first appears, I think) and Turaev-Viro.  For those invariants its very important that your braided tensor category only have finitely many different simple objects.\nThe half-divided powers integral form:\nThis appears in the work of Habiro on universal versions of the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants and on integrality results concerning these invariants.  This integral form looks like the Lusztig form on the upper Borel and like the K-DC form on the lower Borel.  The key advantage is that in the construction of the R-matrix via the Drinfeld double you should be looking at something like U_q(B+) \\otimes U_q(B+)* and it turns out that the dual of the Borel without divided powers is the Borel with divided powers and vice-versa.  There's been very little work done on this case beyond the work of Habiro.", "meta": {"post_id": 10036, "input_score": 31, "output_score": 59, "post_title": "Which is the correct version of a quantum group at a root of unity?"}}
{"input": "This is totally elementary, but I have no idea how to solve it: let $A$ be an abelian group such that $A$ is isomorphic to $A^3$. is then $A$ isomorphic to $A^2$? probably no, but how construct a counterexample? you can also ask this in other categories as well, for example rings. if you restrict to Boolean rings, the question becomes a topological one which makes you think about fractals: let $X$ be Stone space such that $X \\cong X + X + X$, does it follow that $X \\cong X + X$ (here $+$ means disjoint union)?\nEdit: In the answers there are already counterexamples. but you may add others in other categories (with products/coproducts), especially if they are easy to understand :).", "output": "Given a class of structures equipped with a product $(K, \\times)$, the question of whether $X^3 \\cong X \\implies X^2 \\cong X$ holds for every $X \\in K$ is sometimes called the cube problem for $K$, and if it has a positive answer then $K$ is said to have the cube property. For the question to be nontrivial there need to be infinite structures $X \\in K$ that are isomorphic to $X^3$. If there are such structures, it is usually possible to find one that witnesses the failure of the cube property for $K$, that is, an $X \\in K$ such that $X \\cong X^3$ but $X \\not\\cong X^2$. On the other hand, in rare cases the cube property does hold nontrivially.\nI worked on the cube problem for the class of linear orders under the lexicographical product, and while doing so had a chance to look into the history of the problem for other classes of structures. The following list contains most of the results that I am aware of.\nWhen the cube property fails\n-- As far as I know, the first result concerning the failure of the cube property is due to Hanf, who showed in [1] that there exists a Boolean algebra $B$ isomorphic to $B^3$ but not $B^2$. Hanf's example is of size $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n-- Tarski [2] and J\u00f3nsson [3] adapted Hanf's result to get examples showing the failure of the cube property for the class of semigroups, the class of groups, the class of rings, as well as other classes of algebraic structures. Most of their examples are also of size continuum.\nIt was unknown for some time after these results were published whether there exist countable examples witnessing the failure of the cube property for these various classes. Especially famous was the so-called \"Tarski cube problem,\" which asked whether there exists a countable Boolean algebra isomorphic to its cube but not its square.\n-- As Tom Leinster answered, Corner [4] showed, by a very different route, that indeed there exists a countable abelian group isomorphic to its cube but not its square. Later, Jones [5] constructed a finitely generated (necessarily non-abelian) group isomorphic to its cube but not its square.\n-- Around the same time as Corner's result, several authors [6, 7] showed that there exist modules over certain rings isomorphic to their cubes but not their squares.\n-- As Asher Kach answered, Tarski's cube problem was eventually solved by Ketonen, who showed in [8] that there does exist a countable Boolean algebra isomorphic to its cube but not its square.\nKetonen's result is actually far more general. Let $(BA, \\times)$ denote the class of countable Boolean algebras under the direct product. If $(S, \\cdot)$ is a semigroup, then $S$ is said to be represented in $(BA, \\times)$ if there exists a map $i: S \\rightarrow BA$ such that $i(a \\cdot b) \\cong i(a) \\times i(b)$ and $a \\neq b$ implies $i(a) \\not\\cong i(b)$. The statement that there exists a countable Boolean algebra isomorphic to its cube but not its square is equivalent to the statement that $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ can be represented in $(BA, \\times)$. Ketonen showed that every countable commutative semigroup can be represented in $(BA, \\times)$.\n-- Beginning in the 1970s, examples began to appear showing the failure of the cube property for various classes of relational structures. For example, Koubek, Ne\u0161etril, and R\u00f6dl showed that the cube property fails for the class of partial orders, as well as many other classes of relational structures in their paper [9].\n-- Throughout the 70s and 80s, Trnkov\u00e1 and her collaborators showed the failure of the cube property for a vast array of topological and relational classes of structures. Like Ketonen's result, her results are typically much more general.\nHer topological results are summarized in [10], and references are given there. Some highlights:\n\nThere exists a compact metric space $X$ homeomorphic to $X^3$ but not\n$X^2$. More generally, every finite abelian group can be represented\nin the class of compact metric spaces.\nEvery finite abelian group can be represented in the class of\nseparable, compact, Hausdorff, 0-dimensional spaces.\nEvery countable commutative semigroup can be represented in the class\nof countable paracompact spaces.\nEvery countable commutative semigroup can be represented in the class\nof countable Hausdorff spaces.\n\nHer relational results mostly concern showing the failure of the cube property for the class of graphs. For example:\n\nEvery commutative semigroup can be represented in $(K, \\times)$,\nwhere $K$ is the class of graphs and $\\times$ can be taken to be the\ntensor (categorical) product, the cartesian product, or the strong\nproduct [11].\nThere exists a connected graph $G$ isomorphic to $G \\times G \\times\n   G$ but not $G \\times G$, where $\\times$ can be taken to be the tensor\nproduct, or strong product. As of 1984, it was unknown whether\n$\\times$ could be the cartesian product [12].\n\n--Answering a question of Trnkov\u00e1, Orsatti and Rodino showed that there is even a connected topological space homeomorphic to its cube but not its square [13].\n--More recently, as Bill Johnson answered, Gowers showed that there exists a Banach space linearly homeomorphic to its cube but not its square [14].\n--Eklof and Shelah constructed in [15] an $\\aleph_1$-separable group $G$ isomorphic to $G^3$ but not $G^2$, answering a question in ZFC that had previously only been answered under extra set theoretic hypotheses.\n--Eklof revisited the cube problem for modules in [16].\nWhen the cube property holds\nThere are rare instances when the cube property holds nontrivially.\n-- It holds for the class of sets under the cartesian product: any set in bijection with its cube is either infinite, empty, or a singleton, and hence in bijection with its square. This can be proved easily using the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem, and thus holds even in the absence of choice.\n-- Also easily, it also holds for the class of vector spaces over a given field.\n-- Less trivially, it holds for the class of $\\sigma$-complete Boolean algebras, since there is a Schroeder-Bernstein theorem for such algebras.\n-- Trnkov\u00e1  showed in [17] that the cube property holds for the class of countable metrizable spaces (where isomorphism means homeomorphism), and in [18] that it holds for the class of closed subspaces of Cantor space. The cube property fails for the class of $F_{\\sigma \\delta}$ subspaces of Cantor space. It is unknown if it holds or fails for $F_{\\sigma}$ subspaces of Cantor space. See [10].\n-- Koubek, Ne\u0161etril, and R\u00f6dl showed in [9] that the cube property holds for the class of equivalence relations.\n-- I recently showed that the cube property holds for the class of linear orders under the lexicographical product. (My paper is here. See also this MO answer.)\nA theme that comes out of the proofs of these results is that when the cube property holds nontrivially, usually some version of the Schroeder-Bernstein theorem is in play.\nReferences:\n\nWilliam Hanf, MR 108451 On some fundamental problems concerning isomorphism of Boolean algebras, Math.

{"input": "Given a variety (or scheme, or stack, or presheaf on the category of rings), some geometers, myself included, like to study D-modules.  The usual definition of a D-module is as sheaves of modules over a sheaf of differential operators, but for spaces that aren't smooth in some sense, this definition doesn't work that well, and you want to use a different definition.  My overall question is how to reinterpret microlocalization in this alternative definition.\ndeRham spaces\nThis definition is that a D-module on $X$ is a quasi-coherent sheaf on a new space $X_{dR}$, the deRham space of $X$.  It's easiest to define this is in terms of its functor of points:  a map of Spec R to $X_{dR}$ is by definition a map of Spec $R/J_R$ to $X$ where $J_R$ is the nilpotent radical of $R$.  So this is not a topological space, but it is a sheaf on the big Zariski site, and I can make sense of a quasi-0-coherent sheaf on one of those.  For more details, you can see the notes of Jacob Lurie on these.\nMore informally $X_{dR}$ is $X$ \"with all infinitesimally close points identified.\"  A sheaf on this space is like a D-module in that a D-module is a sheaf with a connection, i.e. where the fibers of infinitesimally close points are identified.  You'll note, I say \"space\" here, since I want to be vague about what this object is.  It's very hard from being a scheme, but I believe it is a (EDIT: not actually algebraic!) stack.\nmicrolocalization\nNow, one of the lovely things about D-modules is that they have a secret life on the cotangent bundle of X.  You might think a D-module is a sheaf on X, but this is not the whole picture: there is also a microlocal version of things.  \nThe sheaf of functions on $T^*X$ has a quantization $\\mathcal{O}^h$; this is a non-commutative algebra over $\\mathbb{C}[[h]]$ such that $\\mathcal{O}^h/h\\mathcal{O}^h\\cong \\mathcal{O}_{T^*X}$, defined using Moyal quantization.\nThere's a ring map $p^{-1}\\mathcal{D}\\to \\mathcal{O}^h[h^{-1}]$, and thus a functor from D-modules to sheaves of $\\mathcal{O}^h[h^{-1}]$-modules on $T^*X$ given by $\\mathcal{O}^h[h^{-1}]\\otimes_{p^{-1}\\mathcal{D}}\\mathcal{M}$, called microlocalization, because it makes D-modules even more local than they were before.  This is an equivalence between D-modules and $\\mathbb{C}^*$-equivariant $\\mathcal{O}^h[h^{-1}]$-modules. \nGiven an $\\mathbb{C}^*$ invariant open subset $U$ of $T^*X$, one can look at $\\mathcal{O}^h[h^{-1}]$-modules on $U$, and obtain a microlocalized category of D-modules, which has all kinds of interesting geometry one couldn't see before.  I'm particularly interested in the semi-stable points for the action of some group $G$ on $X$ (extended to $T^*X$).\nmy question:\nNow, I'm something of a convert to derived algebraic geometry, so it feels intuitive to me that anything one has to say about D-modules should be sayable using deRham spaces.  On the other hand, I have no idea how microlocalization can be phrased in this way.  Do any of you out in MathOverflowLand?", "output": "The first thing to say is that the abelian category of \nsheaves on the de Rham space is only a good model \nfor D-modules if you're in the smooth setting, or very close to it (see for example arXiv:math/0212094 for a setting where all the different notions agree).. so unless you're fully derived you need to be careful with this identification.\nIn any case, rather than talk about the de Rham space you can talk about crystals,\nwhich give the right notion in general -- see for example chapter 7 (section 10 or 11) of Beilinson-Drinfeld on Quantization of Hitchin for an excellent discussion.\nAnother picture you might like better is as modules over the enveloping algebroid of the tangent complex -- ie everything is fine if you replace naive differential operators by their correct derived analog. Yet another picture is as dg modules for the de Rham complex. My favorite is as S^1-equivariant sheaves on the derived loop space of X.\n(I assume for all of these we're in characteristic zero, otherwise there are many different analogs of D-modules..)\nIn any case micrlocalization can be said in terms of the deformation to the normal cone of the de Rham groupoid - or the Hodge filtration on nonabelian cohomology, after Simpson. (A good reference for this is Simpson's paper with that title and the awesome preprint on D-modules on stacks by Simpson and Teleman available on the latter's webpage.) Namely there's a canonical deformation (the Hodge stack) from the de Rham space to a stack (not a space this time!) which is the quotient of X by the tangent bundle (acting trivially) -- sheaves on which are the same as quasicoherent sheaves on the cotangent bundle. On the level of sheaves this is just the deformation quantization from sheaves on the cotangent bundle to D-modules with a parameter h - ie we consider modules over the Rees algebra of D rather than over D itself. The category of Rees modules sheafifies over the projectivized cotangent bundle, and so you can define microlocal categories by restricting to your favorite open subsets.\nThis is not so special to the de Rham stack: we're just saying jets of sections of a formal deformation of the category of sheaves on a variety sheafify over this variety. Once you know in general that D-modules degenerate to sheaves on the cotangent bundle, and this is true in arbitrary generality once you define both sides correctly, you can microlocalize (if you take into account correctly the C^* equivariance of the deformation).", "meta": {"post_id": 10556, "input_score": 52, "output_score": 41, "post_title": "D-modules, deRham spaces and microlocalization"}}
{"input": "EGA IV 17.1.6(i) states that formal smoothness is a source-local property. In other words, a map $X\\to Y$ of schemes is formally smooth if and only if there is an open cover $U_i$ ($i\\in I$) of $X$ such that each restriction $U_i\\to Y$ is formally smooth.\nIt seems however that there is a gap in the proof. The problem is in the third paragraph on page 59 (Pub IHES v 32). The reference to (16.5.17) does not give the conclusion they need. Corollary (16.5.18) does give this conclusion, but it requires a finite presentation assumption. (So, everything is OK for smoothness instead of formal smoothness.)\nQuesiton 1: Can someone give a counterexample or a complete proof of 17.1.6(i)? (My bet would be that there's a counterexample.)\nI think the right way of fixing this is to change the definition of formal smoothness. Recall that a map $X\\to Y$ is said to be formally smooth if for any closed immersion $X'\\to Y'$ of affine schemes defined by a square-zero ideal and for map $X'\\to X$ and $Y'\\to Y$ making the induced square commute, there is a map $Y'\\to X$ commuting with all the other maps in the diagram. I think a better definition would to require only that the map $Y'\\to X$ exists locally on $Y'$. \nIf I'm not mistaken, this definition has the following advantages over the old one: a) The definition of smoothness (=formally smooth and locally of finite presentation) would remain unchanged. b) It would make formal smoothness a source-local property. (Or if there is no counterexample to 17.1.16(i), then the argument with the new definition would be much easier than an argument like the one in EGA, in that it would not depend on the facts in scheme theory that the sheaf of lifts $Y'\\to X$ is a torsor for a sheaf derivations and that therefore, since $Y'$ is affine, there is always a global section.) In particular, it would probably be better suited for maps of general sheaves of sets on the big Zariski topology, rather than just schemes. d) It's a general rule of thumb that, in sheaf theory, it's easier to work with local existential quantifiers than global ones.\nQuestion 2: Does anyone know of any reason why this new definition would be bad?", "output": "Let me point out the following remark made by Grothendieck in his book \"Cat\u00e9gories Cofibre\u00e9s Additives et Complexe Cotangent Relatif\", 9.5.8\nPlease excuse my translation:\n\"Let $f:X \\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes.  We say that $f$ is \"locally formally smooth\" if X can be covered by opens $X_i$ which are formally smooth over $Y$.  Evidently, if $f$ is formally smooth, then it is locally formally smooth; I don't know if the converse is true in general.  It was this which was affirmed hastily in EGA IV 17.1.6 but the proof is only valid when we assume that the relative $\\Omega^1$ is of finite presentation, for example if $f$ is locally of finite type.  The Lemma 9.5.7 [loc. cit., not reproduced] implies the following criterion : the map $f$ is locally formally smooth if and only if one has $N_{X/Y} = 0$ and $\\Omega^1_{X/Y}$ is \"locally projective\" in the following sense : one can cover $X$ by open affines $X_i$ with rings $B_i$ such that over $X_i$ the quasi-coherent module $\\Omega^1_{X/Y}$ is given by a projective $B_i$ module.  We will know that this condition implies the formal smoothness of $f$ if we can show that for a commutative ring $B$, every $B$ module $N$ which is locally projective is also projective - or what amounts to the same - it satisfies $H^1(X, \\operatorname{Hom}(\\tilde{N}, J)) = 0$ for each quasi-coherent module $J$ on $\\operatorname{Spec}(B)$.\"\nApparently, this local nature of projectivity was shown soon thereafter by Raynaud and Gruson (\"Crit\u00e9res de platitude et projectivit\u00e9\").

According to Borel-Weil-Bott, $H^0(G/B,L)$ is $V_{\\lambda}$, the irreducible representation of $G$ with highest weight $\\lambda$, and $H^i(G/B,L)=0$ for $i>0$. So the holomorphic Euler characteristic of $L$ is $\\mathrm{dim} \\ V_{\\lambda}$.\nAs we will see, computing  the holomorphic Euler characteristic of $L$ by Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch gives the Weyl character formula for $\\mathrm{dim} \\ V_{\\lambda}$.\n Notation:\n$G$ is a simply-connected semi-simple algebraic group, $B$ a Borel and $T$ the maximal torus in $B$. The corresponding Lie algebras are $\\mathfrak{g}$, $\\mathfrak{b}$, $\\mathfrak{t}$. The Weyl group is $W$, the length function on $W$ is $\\ell$ and the positive roots are $\\Phi^{+}$. It will simplify many signs later to take $B$ to be a lower Borel,  so the weights of $T$ acting on $\\mathfrak{b}$ are $\\Phi^{-}$.\nWe will need notations for the following objects:\n$$\\rho = (1/2) \\sum_{\\alpha \\in \\Phi^{+}} \\alpha.$$\n$$\\Delta = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\Phi^{+}} \\alpha.$$\n$$\\delta = \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\Phi^{+}} (e^{\\alpha/2}-e^{-\\alpha/2}).$$\nThey respectively live in $\\mathfrak{t}^*$, in the polynomial ring $\\mathbb{C}[\\mathfrak{t}^*]$ and in the power series ring $\\mathbb{C}[[\\mathfrak{t}^*]]$.\nGeometry of flag varieties\nEvery line bundle $L$ on $G/B$ can be made $G$-equivariant in a unique way. Writing $x$ for the point $B/B$, the Borel $B$ acts on the fiber $L_x$ by some character of $T$. This is a bijection between line bundles on $G/B$ and characters of $T$. Taking chern classes of line bundles gives classes in $H^2(G/B)$. This extends to an isomorphism $\\mathfrak{t}^* \\to H^2(G/B, \\mathbb{C})$ and a surjection $\\mathbb{C}[[\\mathfrak{t}^*]] \\to H^*(G/B, \\mathbb{C})$.  We will often abuse notation by identifiying a power series in $\\mathbb{C}[[\\mathfrak{t}^*]]$ with its image in $H^*(G/B)$.\nWe will need to know the Chern roots of the cotangent bundle to $G/B$.\nAgain writing $x$ for the point $B/B$, the Borel $B$ acts on the tangent space $T_x(G/B)$ by the adjoint action of $B$ on $\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{b}$. As a $T$-representation, $\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{b}$ breaks into a sum of one dimensional representations, with characters the positive roots. We can order these summands to give a $B$-equivariant filtration of $\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak{b}$ whose quotients are the corresponding characters of $B$. Translating this filtration around $G/B$, we get a filtration on the tangent bundle whose associated graded is the direct sum of line bundles indexed by the positive roots. So the Chern roots of the tangent bundle are $\\Phi^{+}$. (The signs in this paragraph would be reversed if $B$ were an upper Borel.)\nThe Weyl group $W$ acts on $\\mathfrak{t}^*$. This extends to an action of $W$ on $H^*(G/B)$. The easiest way to see this is to use the diffeomorphism between $G/B$ and $K/(K \\cap T)$, where $K$ is a maximal compact subgroup of $G$; the Weyl group normalizes $K$ and $T$ so it gives an action on $K/(K \\cap T)$.\nWe need the following formula, valid for any $h \\in \\mathbb{C}[[\\mathfrak{t}^*]]$:\n$$\\int h = \\ \\mbox{constant term of}\\left( (\\sum_{w \\in W} (-1)^{\\ell(w)} w^*h)/\\Delta \\right). \\quad (*)$$\nTwo comments: on the left hand side,  we are considering $h \\in H^*(G/B)$ and using the standard notation that $\\int$ means \"discard all components not in top degree and integrate.\" On the right hand side, we are working in $\\mathbb{C}[[\\mathfrak{t}^*]]$, as $\\Delta$ is a zero divisor in $H^*(G/B)$.\nSketch of proof of (*): The action of $w$ is orientation reversing or preserving according to the sign of $\\ell(w)$. So $\\int h = \\int (\\sum_{w \\in W} (-1)^{\\ell(w)} w^*h) / |W|$. Since the power series $\\sum_{w \\in W} (-1)^{\\ell(w)} w^*h$ is alternating, it is divisible by $\\Delta$ and must be of the form $\\Delta(k + (\\mbox{higher order terms}))$ for some constant $k$. The higher order terms, multiplied by $\\Delta$, all vanish in $H^*(G/B)$, so we have $\\int h = k \\int \\Delta/|W|$. The right hand side of $(*)$ is just $k$.\nBy the Chern root computation above, the top chern class of the tangent bundle is $\\Delta$. So $\\int \\Delta$ is the (topological) Euler characteristic of $G/B$. The Bruhat decomposition of $G/B$ has one even-dimensional cell for every element of $W$, and no odd cells, so $\\int \\Delta = |W|$ and we have proved formula $(*)$.\nThe computation\nWe now have all the ingredients.

A brief glance at Wikipedia suggests that the Hadamard product formula could give a proof: if there are no non-trivial zeros then you get a suspiciously nice formula for \u03b6(s) itself.

Perhaps magic is needed.\nA very closely related question is this. Does the existence of non-trivial zeros on the critical strip imply anything about the distribution of prime numbers?

Also note that the proof will not make any use \n of the functional equation for $\\zeta(s)$ as this does not exist in a general semigroup. \nEDIT:  Indeed doing a literature search a few hours after posting this, \nI found a paper of Hilberdink http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X04002069 which proves the \nTheorem below, and with a similar method of proof. \nSuppose that $1<p_1< p_2 <\\ldots$ is a sequence of real numbers (the \"primes\"), and \n $1=a_1 \\le a_2 \\le \\ldots$ is the semigroup generated by them (the \"integers\").

Let $N(x)$ denote the number of \n\"integers\" below $x$, and \n$$\nP(x) = \\sum_{p_n^{k} \\le x} \\log p_n,\n$$ \nwhich is the analog of the usual $\\psi(x)$ (counting prime powers with weight $\\log p$).

Thus \n$\\zeta_A(s)$ has no zeros in Re$(s)>1/2-\\delta$.  \nNew edit: Sketch of a second proof.  Adapting the argument that the Riemann hypothesis implies the Lindelof hypothesis (see below), we obtain that $|\\zeta_A(s)| \\ll (1+|s|)^{\\epsilon}$ provided $s$ is not close to the pole at $1$, and that Re$(s)>1/2-\\delta/2$.

From \nthe analytic continuation of $\\zeta_A$ (using that $N(x)$ is very regular), it follows \nthat there is an a priori polynomial bound $|\\zeta_A(s)|\\ll |s|^{B}$ in the region Re$(s)>1/2-\\delta/2$.  Thus there is a bound for the real part of $\\log \\zeta_{A}(s)$, and by the Borel-Caratheodory lemma (standard complex analysis) one can bootstrap this to a bound for $|\\log \\zeta_A(s)|$.  Then applying the Hadamard three circle theorem to $\\log \\zeta_A(s)$ one obtains a much better bound: $|\\zeta_A(s)| \\ll |s|^{\\epsilon}$.   This is the usual proof that Riemann implies Lindelof.  (At this stage, if we knew a \"functional equation\" we'd be done, as the usual $\\zeta(s)$ is large when Re$(s)<1/2$.  This point appeared in Matt Young's answers earlier.)\nKnowing the Lindelof hypothesis for $\\zeta_A(s)$ in Re$(s)> 1/2-\\delta/2$, we can \nshow the following approximate formula: for $\\sigma > 1/2- \\delta/4$ \n$$ \n\\zeta_A(\\sigma +it) = \\sum_{a_n \\le N} a_n^{-\\sigma-it} + O(|t|^{\\epsilon} N^{-\\delta/4}). \n$$ \nThe proof is standard;  see the penultimate chapter of Titchmarsh for the real $\\zeta(s)$ where this holds when $\\sigma$ is strictly bigger than $1/2$, and our stronger result is true because we have Lindelof in a wider region.  \nNow we are ready to get our contradiction.  Consider for large $T$ \n$$ \n\\int_T^{2T} |\\zeta_A(1/2+it)|^2  dt. \n$$ \nTo do this carefully it may be helpful to put in a smooth weight $\\Phi(t/T)$ above \n(but this is not a paper!).  Using the approximate formula derived above, and our mild spacing condition $a_{n+1}-a_n \\gg n^{-1}$, \nwe may see that for any $T^{\\epsilon} \\le N \\le T^{1/10}$ we have \n$$ \n\\int_T^{2T} |\\zeta_A(1/2+it)|^2 dt \\sim T \\sum_{a_n \\le N} a_n^{-1} \\sim AT \\log N.\n$$ \nBut that's absurd!

Is it true that for every algebraic integer $x$ in $Z$ either $x$ or $-x$ is a sum of squares?", "output": "To address the particularities of this question for number fields, the basic theorem is attributed to Hilbert, Landau and Siegel.  First of all, any nonzero sum of squares in a number field has to be totally positive (that is, it is positive in all real embeddings).  Hilbert (1902) conjectured that in any number field, a totally positive element is a sum of 4 squares in the number field. This was proved by Landau (1919) for quadratic fields and by Siegel (1921) for all number fields. \nThis sounds superficially like a direct extension of Lagrange's theorem, but there is a catch: it is about field elements, not algebraic integers as sums of squares of algebraic integers. A totally positive algebraic integer in a number field $K$ need not be a sum of 4 squares of algebraic integers in $K$. The Hilbert-Landau-Siegel theorem only says it is a sum of 4 squares of algebraic numbers in $K$. \nFor instance, in $\\mathbf{Q}(i)$ all elements are totally positive in a vacuous sense (no real embeddings), so every element is a sum of four squares.  As an example,\n$$\ni = \\left(\\frac{1+i}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1+i}{2}\\right)^2.\n$$\nThis shows $i$ is a sum of two squares in $\\mathbf{Q}(i)$. \nIt is impossible to write $i$ as a finite sum of squares in ${\\mathbf Z}[i]$ since \n$$\n(a+bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi\n$$\nhas even imaginary part when $a$ and $b$ are in $\\mathbf{Z}$.  Thus any finite sum of squares in $\\mathbf{Z}[i]$ has even imaginary part, so such a sum can't equal $i$.\nTherefore it is false that every totally positive algebraic integer in a number field is a sum of 4 squares (or even any number of squares) of algebraic integers.\nHere are some further examples:\n\nIn $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $5 + 3\\sqrt{2}$ is totally positive since \n$5+3\\sqrt{2}$ and $5-3\\sqrt{2}$ are both positive.  So it must be a sum of at most four squares in this field by Hilbert's theorem, and with a little fiddling around you find \n$$\n5 + 3\\sqrt{2} = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2 + \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2.\n$$\nIt is impossible to write $5 + 3\\sqrt{2}$ as a sum of squares in the ring of integers $\\mathbf{Z}[\\sqrt{2}]$ because of the parity obstruction we saw for $i$ as a sum of squares in $\\mathbf{Z}[i]$: the coefficient of $\\sqrt{2}$ in $5 + 3\\sqrt{2}$ is odd.\nIn $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\sqrt{2}$ is not totally positive (it becomes negative when we replace $\\sqrt{2}$ with $-\\sqrt{2}$), so it can't be a sum of squares in this field. But in the larger field $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{2},i)$, everything is totally positive in a vacuous sense so everything is a sum of at most four squares in this field by the Hilbert-Landau-Siegel theorem.  And looking at $\\sqrt{2}$ in $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{2},i)$, we find \n$$\n\\sqrt{2} = \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + i^2 + \\left(\\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2.\n$$\n\nHilbert made his conjecture on totally positive numbers being sums of four squares as a theorem, in his Foundations of Geometry. It is Theorem 42. He says the proof is quite hard, and no proof is included. A copy of the book (in English) is available at the time I write this as http://math.berkeley.edu/~wodzicki/160/Hilbert.pdf. See page 83 of the file (= page 78 of the book).\nSiegel's work on this theorem/conjecture was done just before the Hasse-Minkowski theorem was established in all number fields (by Hasse), and the former can be regarded as a special instance of the latter. \nIndeed, for nonzero $\\alpha$ in a number field $K$, consider the quadratic form $$Q(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2-\\alpha{x}_5^2.$$ To say $\\alpha$ is a sum of four squares in $K$ is equivalent to saying $Q$ has a nontrivial zero over $K$. (In one direction, if $\\alpha$ is a sum of four squares over $K$ then $Q$ has a nontrivial zero over $K$ where $x_5 = 1$. In the other direction, if $Q$ has a nontrivial zero over $K$ where $x_5 \\not= 0$ then we can scale and make $x_5 = 1$, thus exhibiting $\\alpha$ as a sum of four squares in $K$. If $Q$ has a nontrivial zero over $K$ where $x_5 = 0$ then the sum of four squares quadratic form represents 0 nontrivially over $K$ and thus it is universal over $K$, so it represents $\\alpha$ over $K$.) By Hasse-Minkowski, $Q$ represents 0 nontrivially over $K$ if and only if it represents 0 nontrivially over every completion of $K$. \nSince any nondegenerate quadratic form in five or more variables over a local field or the complex numbers represents 0 nontrivially, $Q$ represents 0 nontrivially over $K$ if and only it represents 0 nontrivially in every completion of $K$ that is isomorphic to ${\\mathbf R}$. The real completions of $K$ arise precisely from embeddings $K \\rightarrow {\\mathbf R}$. For $t \\in {\\mathbf R}^\\times$, the equation \n$x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2-t{x}_5^2 =0$ has a nontrivial real solution if and only if $t > 0$, so $Q$ has a nontrivial representation of 0 in every real completion of $K$ if and only if $\\alpha$ is positive in every embedding of $K$ into ${\\mathbf R}$, which is what it means for $\\alpha$ to be totally positive. (Strictly speaking, to be totally positive in a field means being positive in every ordering on the field. The orderings on a number field all arise from embeddings of the number field into $\\mathbf R$, so being totally positive in a number field is the same as being positive in every real completion.)\nSiegel's paper is \"Darstellung total positiver Zahlen durch Quadrate, Math.

I wasted a lot of time as a student trying to relate the \"3 points through a line\" definition of the group law over fields with the concept of \"reduction mod $p$\" on points. Likewise, the approach with formal groups tends to make things confusing, despite their apparent \"concreteness\". \nThis sort of stuff drove me crazy when I was a student, until I realized that the best way to understand such topics is to give up working over fields and with equations, and to work over the valuation ring and with functorial viewpoints (only translating into field language at the very end).  The relevant schemes in the question are really torsion schemes over the valuation ring, not torsion in the separate fibers (so you mean to assume $E$ has good reduction in both questions).  I address this below. The following answer is way too long, since I do not know of a suitable reference not involving EGA/SGA. Tate's article on finite flat group schemes probably explains some aspects, but I doubt it addresses the link with the concrete stuff for elliptic curves.  \nIf $R$ is a local ring, then an \"elliptic curve over $R$\" can be defined in two ways:  the concrete way is as a Weierstrass plane cubic with unit discriminant, and the right way is as a smooth proper $R$-scheme with geometrically connected fibers of dimension 1 and genus 1 and a distinguished section.  As usual, the concrete way is hard to use to actually prove anything interesting (and it is the \"wrong\" notion when the base is non-local and especially has non-trivial line bundles; e.g., over suitable number fields with class number $> 1$ one can make CM elliptic curves with \"everywhere good reduction\" which do not admit a global planar model with unit discriminant).   How to prove there is a unique $R$-group structure with the indicated section as the identity?  A real nightmare with the concrete definition, and elegantly explained in Chapter 2 of Katz-Mazur with the right definition. Likewise, that $E$ is functorial in its generic fiber when $R$ is a discrete valuation ring is a mess to prove by hand (which affine opens to use?), but has an elegant proof when approached through the \"smooth and proper\" viewpoint.  Of course it is important and interesting that these concrete and abstract notions agree, and that is explained in Katz-Mazur Chapter 2.   \nThat being said, if $E$ is an elliptic curve over any noetherian (say) scheme $S$ and $[n]_E:E \\rightarrow E$ is multiplication by a positive integer $n$, then on geometric fibers this is a finite flat map, so $[n]$ is quasi-finite.  Now proper and quasi-finite maps are finite (by Zariski's Main Theorem), so $[n]_E$ is a finite map, and the fibral flatness criterion implies that it is also flat.  Being a finite flat map between noetherian schemes, it has a \"degree\" which is locally constant on the target and yet is $n^2$ on fibers over $S$.  Hence, we conclude that $E[n] := {\\rm{ker}}([n]_E)$ is a finite flat commutative $S$-group with constant fiber rank $n^2$. Honestly, I do not know any way to prove this which avoids the serious results that I just cited.  But that's why the theorems are useful:  because we can use them to make our intuition over fields carry over to cases when the base is not a field. (The noetherian condition can be dropped if we are more careful with the phrase \"finite flat\". I won't dwell on it here.) This answers the first part of the 2nd question (taking the base to be spectrum of the valuation ring there).  It the notation there, the $p$-torsion of the elliptic curve over $K$ is not a finite $R$-scheme, and in general it may extend to a finite flat $R$-group in many ways.  But the elliptic curve over $K$ uniquely extends to one over $R$ by the theory of Neron models, and its torsion levels provide the \"right\" finite flat groups you want to use over the valuation ring. \nOK, now assume $R$ is a complete local noetherian ring (e.g., a complete discrete valuation ring).  Could even assume it is a henselian local ring, but the complete case is easier to deal with and covers the case in the question.  Let $G$ be a finite flat $R$-group, a case of interest being $E[n]$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over $R$.  Let $k$ be the residue field, and consider $G_k$.  Being a finite $k$-scheme, it has an open and closed identity component $G_k^0$ which is cut out by an idempotent.  By 8.15 (or thereabouts) in Matsumura's Commutative Ring Theory, every idempotent in the special fiber of a finite $R$-algebra uniquely lifts.  In particular, if $X$ is a finite $R$-scheme then its connected component decomposition uniquely lifts that of $X_k$.  If $X$ is $R$-flat then so is each of its connected components. This is all compatible with products, so if $X$ has a structure of $R$-group then the open and closed connected component $X^0$ containing the identity section is an $R$-subgroup.  Returning to our friend $G$, we get the so-called \"relative identity component\" $G^0$, an open and closed (hence finite flat) $R$-subgroup. \nRemark:  The formation of $G^0$ commutes with any flat local extension on $R$, as follows from the uniqueness!  It doesn't usually commute with non-local extension, such as inclusion of a complete dvr into its fraction field. \nExample: $G = E[n]$.  Suppose $R$ is a complete discrete valuation ring with fraction field $K$, and $n \\in K^{\\times}$.  What is $(G^0)_K$?  Well, each \"point\" occurs over a finite extension $K'/K$, say with valuation ring $R'$, and $G(K') = G(R')$ by elementary integrality considerations (or in fancy terms, valuative criterion, which is killing a fly with a sledgehammer). Since the spectrum of $R'$ is connected, a point in $G(R')$ lies in $G^0(R')$ if and only if its specialization into $G_k(k')$ vanishes ($k'$ the residue field of $R'$).  In other words, $(G^0)(\\overline{K})$ consists of the $n$-torsion geometric points of $E_K$ whose specialization into geometric points of $E_k$ by valuative criterion for the $R$-proper $E$ ($E_K(K') = E(R') \\rightarrow E(k') = E_k(k')$!) is 0. \nNow we need to explain the \"etale quotient\" in concrete terms.  This is best understood as a generalization of the following procedure over a field. \nExample:  Let $k$ be a field and $A_0$ a finite $k$-algebra.  There is a unique maximal \\'etale $k$-subalgebra $A_0'$ in $A_0$: concretely, in each local factor ring of $A_0$ uniquely lift the separable closure of $k$ in the residue field up into the local factor ring via Hensel's Lemma and the primitive element theorem. Since it is uniquely characterized by lifting separable closures of $k$ in the residue fields of the factor rings, it is a good exercise to check the following crucial thing:  if $B_0$ is another finite $k$-algebra then $(A_0 \\otimes_k B_0)' = A_0' \\otimes_k B_0'$, and $A_0'$ is functorial in $A_0$.  Observe that $A_0' \\rightarrow A_0$ is faithfully flat since at the level of factor rings of $A_0$ it is an inclusion of a field into a nonzero ring. Also observe that any \\'etale $k$-algebra equipped with a map to $A_0$ uniquely factors through $A_0'$. \nExercise: The formation of $A_0'$ commutes with any field extension on $k$. (Hint: use Galois descent to reduce to the separate cases of separable algebraic extensions and the easy case $k = k_s$.) \nIn geometric terms, for a finite $k$-scheme $X_0$, the preceding Example constructs a finite \\'etale $k$-scheme $X_0'$ and a faithfully flat $k$-map $f_0:X_0 \\rightarrow X_0'$ which is initial among all $k$-maps from $X_0$ to finite \\'etale $k$-schemes, and its formation is functorial in $X_0$ and commutes with products in $X_0$ and with any extension on $k$.  In particular, if $X_0$ is a $k$-group then $X_0'$ has a unique $k$-group structure making $f_0:X_0 \\rightarrow X_0'$ a $k$-homomorphism. \nExample: Now let $R$ be a complete discrete valuation ring with residue field $k$, and let $X$ be a finite flat $R$-scheme.  (Can relax the hypothesis on $R$ if familiar with finite \\'etale maps in general.) In this setting, \"finite 'etale\" over $R$ just means \"product of finitely many unramified finite extensions\".  By using Hensel's Lemma in finite local $R$-algebras, to give a map from a finite \\'etale $R$-algebra $A$ to a finite $R$-algebra $B$ is the same as to give a map $A_0 \\rightarrow B_0$ between their special fibers.  In particular, finite \\'etale $k$-algebras uniquely and functorially lift to finite \\'etale $R$-algebras, and so $X_0'$ uniquely lifts to a finite \\'etale $R$-scheme $X'$ and there is a unique $R$-map $f:X \\rightarrow X'$ lifting $f_0:X_0 \\rightarrow X_0'$.  By fibral flatness (using $X$ is $R$-flat!), $f$ is faithfully flat since $f_0$ is.  By uniqueness of everything in sight, the formation of $f$ commutes with products and local extension on $R$ and is also functorial in $X$.  In particular, if $G$ is a finite flat $R$-group then $G'$ admits a unique $R$-group structure making $f$ an $R$-homomorphism. We call $G'$ the maximal \\'etale quotient of $G$.  \nNow we can put it all together and obtain the connected-etale sequence:\nProposition:  Let $G$ be a finite flat group scheme over a complete discrete valuation ring $R$. (Even ok for complete local noetherian $R$, or even henselian local $R$.) The faithfully flat $R$-homomorphism $f:G \\rightarrow G'$ to the maximal \\'etale quotient has scheme-theoretic kernel $G^0$.\nProof: The kernel $H = \\ker f$ is a finite flat $R$-group.  To show it contains $G^0$ we have to check that the composite map $G^0 \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow G'$ vanishes.  Being a map from a finite $R$-scheme to a finite \\'etale $R$-scheme, the map is determined by what it does on the special fiber, so it suffices to show that $G_k^0 \\rightarrow G_0'$ vanishes.  This is a map from a finite infinitsimal $k$-scheme to a finite \\'etale $k$-scheme which carries the unique $k$-point to the identity point.  Thus, it factors through the identity section of $G_0'$, which is open and closed since $G_0'$ is finite etale over $k$.   \nNow that $H$ contains $G^0$, to prove the resulting closed immersion $G^0 \\hookrightarrow H$ between finite flat $R$-schemes is an isomorphism it suffices to do so on special fibers.  But that reduces us to the variant of our problem over the residue field.  We can increase it to be algebraically closed, and so the problem is to show that if $G$ is a finite flat group scheme over an algebraically closed field $k$ then $G \\rightarrow G'$ has kernel exactly $G^0$.  But $G'$ is a constant $k$-scheme since it is etale and $k$ is algebraically closed, so by construction $G'$ is just the disjoint union of the $k$-points of the connected components of $G$.  It is then physically obvious that the kernel is $G^0$. QED\nRemark: If $X$ is any finite flat $R$-scheme, with $X \\rightarrow X'$ the initial map to\na finite \\'etale $R$-scheme, then the induced map on $\\overline{k}$-points is bijective.  Indeed, we can pass to geometric special fibers and connected components to reduce to the case when $X$ is local finite over an algebraically closed field (in place of $R$), in which case the assertion is clear. \nBy this Remark, the geometric points of the $n$-torsion in $E_k$ are identified with the geometric points of the special fiber of the maximal etale quotient $E[n]'$.  In particular, if $n$ is not divisible by the characteristic of $K$ and if $K'/K$ is a sufficiently big finite separable extension which splits $E_K[n]$ then the finite etale $R'$-scheme $E[n]'_{R'}$ is constant (as it may be checked on $K'$-fiber), so the map \n$$E _K[n] (\\overline{K}) = E _K[n]  (K') = E[n] (R') \\rightarrow E[n]' (k') \\hookrightarrow\nE  _k[n]' (\\overline{k}) = E[n]'(R') = E[n]' (\\overline{K})$$\nis identified with the naive map in question 1. In other words, that step computes the \"quotient\" part of the connected-etale sequence of $E[n]$ after passing to $\\overline{K}$-points!\nExample: If $E$ has supersingular reduction then $E[p] = E[p]^0$ and the etale part of the sequence for $E[p]$ vanishes.\nExample: If $E$ has ordinary reduction then working over an algebraic closure of the residue field shows that $E[p]^0$ and $E[p]'$ each have rank $p$ as finite flat $R$-groups. \nFinally, it remains to relate $E[n]^0$ to $n$-torsion in the so-called \"formal group\" of $E$ (not the formal group of $E_K$, which loses contact with the integral structure and for ${\\rm{char}} (K) = 0$ is actually the formal additive group which has no nontrivial $n$-torsion!).  A moment's reflection on the definition of the formal group in Silverman shows that its $R'$-points for any finite local valuation ring extension of $R$ are precisely the local $R'$-points of the complete local ring  $\\widehat{\\mathcal{O}}_{E,0_k}$ at the origin of the special fiber (or the completion along the identity section, comes to the same since $R$ is complete). By the universal properties of local rings on schemes and completions of local noetherian rings, such $R'$-points of the latter type are simply points in $E(R')$ specializing to $0_k$ in $E_k (k')$.   But we saw earlier that $E[n]^0 (R')$ is exactly the set of points in $E[n] (R')$ specializing to $0_k$ on $E_k$.  So indeed $E[n]^0 (R')$ inside of $E[n] (R') = E_K[n] (K')$ is exactly the $n$-torsion in the $K'$-points of the \"formal group\" in the sense of Silverman's book. \nVoila, so that answers the questions.

{"input": "I am not an expert, but there seems to be an enormous technical difference between algebraic geometry and differential/metric geometry stemming from the fact that there is apparently no such thing as curvature in the former context while curvature is everywhere in the latter (indeed, it is hard to produce nontrivial results in Riemannian geometry that DON'T involve curvature).  Of course it seems unreasonable to just port definitions of curvature into an algebraic context, but maybe there are constructions that play the same role in algebraic geometry that curvature does in other kinds of geometry.

It involves some of the most basic notions in commutative algebra, and really sounds as though it should be easy (the graded case, for example, is easy), but it's not.  The question at least goes as far back as Serre's FAC, but it wasn't proved until 1976, by Quillen in Projective modules over polynomial rings EDIT: and also independently by Suslin.\nI decided that this is the sort of fact that I should know a rough outline of how to prove, but the paper was not very helpful.  Usually when someone kills off a famous conjecture in 5 pages, it's because they've developed some fantastic new piece of machinery people didn't have before.

You may still want to read what follows, for a bit of motivation]\nHistorically, I'd bet people started to look at concrete metric spaces $(X,d)$ before exploring the utility of the abstraction given by general topological spaces $(X,\\tau)$ ($\\tau$ is a topology). The heuristic idea captured by the concept of a topological space is endowing a set $X$ with a \"geometry\" that forgets the rigidity of a hypothetical metric structure $(X,d)$, though retaining the \"qualitative\" aspects of the geometry given by the metric. \nOf course there are non-metrizable topological spaces, but let stick to metrizable ones for the moment. I think it should be possible to see a topological space $(X,\\tau)$ as an equivalence class of metric spaces: $(X,[d])$, where $[d]$ is the class of all metrics on the set $X$ that give rise to the same topology. So, an $(X,\\tau)$ just has several \"rigid\" models $(X,d)$, and a morphism of topological spaces $f:(X,\\tau) \\rightarrow (Y,\\tau')$ is given by taking any map $(X,d) \\rightarrow (Y,d^{'})$ of \"representatives\" which is continuous according to the \"metric ball\" definition.\n[Please correct the above picture if it is imprecise or even just wrong!!]\nThe (perhaps naive) way I have always thought about homotopy is that it is an even \"further step\" in making the geometry more \"qualitative\" and less rigid: you can \"collapse positive dimensional appendices\" of a space as far as they are contractible, and so forth. When trying to make this formal, you consider \"homotopy types\", which are equivalence classes $[(X,\\tau)]$ of topological spaces, where $(X,\\tau) \\sim (X',\\tau')$ if there is a homotopy equivalence $\\varphi:(X,\\tau) \\rightarrow (X',\\tau')$. What are morphisms in the homotopy category? Just morphisms $f$ between \"representatives\", but now you have also to consider them up to homotopy, i.e. you take $[f]$ where $f \\sim f'$ if there's a homotopy $\\alpha: f \\rightarrow f'$.\nIt's ugly to think of topological spaces as $[(X,d)]$ (or, rather, $(X,[d])$): it's better to use the simpler and more expressive abstraction $(X,\\tau)$.\nSo, the question is:\n\nIs there some kind of \"homotopology\" $h$ (whatever it is) that one can put on sets $S$ so that each homotopy type $[(X,\\tau)]$ is fully described by a \"homotopical space\" (whatever it is) $(S,h)$ and homotopy classes of morphisms $[f]$ correspond to \"$h$-compatible\" (whatever it means) set-theoretic maps $F:S \\rightarrow S'$?\n\n(I don't even dare asking about the existence of \"non-topologizable homotopical spaces\" because the above question is already by far too vague!)", "output": "No.", "meta": {"post_id": 21667, "input_score": 41, "output_score": 59, "post_title": "Are there any \"homotopical spaces\"?"}}

This is not a big surprise since de Rham cohomology really just gives the dimensions of the spaces of solutions to certain PDE's, but I'm wondering if there is some other way to directly use the differentiable structure of a manifold to recover torsion.

{"input": "Disclaimer\nOf course not, I'm aware of G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem. Still there is something which does not persuade me, maybe it's just that I've taken my logic class too long ago. On the other hand, it may turn out I'm just confused. :-)\nBackground\nI will be talking about models of set theory; these are sets on their own, so a confusion can arise, since the symbol $\\in$, viewed as \"set belonging\" in the usual sense, may have a different meaning from the symbol $\\in$ of the theory. So, to avoid confusion, I will speak about levels.\nOn the first level is the set theory mathematicians use all day. This has axioms, but is not a theory in the usual sense of logic. Indeed, to speak about logic we already need sets (to define alphabets and so on). In this naif set theory we develop logic, in particular the notions of theory and model. We call this theory Set1.\nOn the second level is the formalized set theory; this is a theory in the sense of logic. We just copy the axioms of the naif set theory and take the (formal) theory which has these strings of symbols as axioms. We call this theory Set2.\nNow G\u00f6del's result tells us that if Set2 is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistence. Well, here we need to be a bit more precise. The claim as stated is obvious, since Set2 cannot prove anything about the sets in the first level. It does not even know that they exist.\nSo we repeat the process that carried from Set1 to Set2: we define in Set2 the usual notions of logic (alphabets, theories, models...) and use these to define another theory Set3.\nA correct statement of G\u00f6del's result is, I think, that\n\nif Set2 is consistent, then it cannot prove the consistence of Set3.\n\nThe problem\nOk, so we have a clear statement which seems to be completely provable in Set1, and indeed it is. This doesn't tell us, however that\n\nif Set1 is consistent, then it cannot prove the consistence of Set2.\n\nSo I'm left with the doubt that what one can do \"from the outside\" may be a bit more than what one can do in the formalized theory. Compare this with G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem, where one has a statement which is true for natural numbers (and we can prove it from the outside) but which is not provable in PA.\nSo the question is:\n\nis there any reason to believe that Set1 cannot prove the consistence of Set2? Or I'm just confused and what I said does not make sense?\n\nOf course one could just argue that Set1, not being formalized, is not amenable to mathematical investigation; the best model we have is Set2, so we should trust that we can always \"shift our theorems one level\". But this argument does not convince me: indeed G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem shows that we have situations where the theorem in the formalized theory are strictly less then what we can see from the outside.\nFinal comment\nIn a certain sense, it is far from intuitive that set theory should have a model. Because models are required to be sets, and sets are so small...\nOf course I know about universes, and how one can use them to \"embed\" the theory of classes inside set theory, so sets may be bigger than I think. But then again, existence of universes is not provable from the usual axioms of set theory.", "output": "Your question certainly makes sense and it is a point that I feel is too often glossed over in textbooks.\nLet me rephrase your question.  Goedel's second theorem says that, assuming that a certain formal system (ZFC, say) has a certain property that we call \"consistency,\" then there is no formal proof in ZFC of a certain string, commonly denoted by \"Con(ZFC).\"  Fine.  But why on earth should this theorem say anything about whether the consistency of ZFC can be proved mathematically?  The theorem is just a theorem about abstract strings of symbols, not about what human beings can and cannot do.  The string denoted \"Con(ZFC)\" is commonly taken to \"say\" that \"ZFC is consistent,\" but what is the justification for doing so?  A string is just a string, and doesn't \"say\" anything.  If we choose to think of the string as \"meaning\" something then that's our business, but surely that kind of human social activity is not something we can prove mathematical theorems about?\nThe answer is that, underlying the usual discussions of Goedel's second theorem, there is the following Key Assumption: If someone were to come up with a mathematical proof of the consistency of ZFC, then by mimicking that proof, we could produce a formal proof of Con(ZFC) from the axioms of ZFC.  The Key Assumption is crucial.  Without it, we cannot make the leap from Goedel's second theorem to a meta-mathematical statement about the (im)possibility of proving the consistency of mathematics.  And note that the Key Assumption is not a purely mathematical one; it cannot be, because it is a statement linking something that is not purely mathematical (namely, mathematical proof, which is a product of human activity) and something that is purely mathematical (namely, ZFC and theorems of ZFC).  Therefore the Key Assumption is not susceptible to mathematical proof, and the reasons we have for accepting it must be in part philosophical.\nSo what reasons do we have for accepting the Key Assumption?  The chief reason is that long experience has taught us that all mathematical proofs that mathematicians come up with can indeed be mimicked by formal proofs in ZFC.  This may seem obvious to us today, but it is not at all a trivial statement.  Prior to the set-theoretic revolution, it was by no means obvious that all the diverse areas of mathematics could be formulated in a single common language (i.e., set theory) and deduced from a short list of axioms.  It is only through the hard work of those working in the foundations of mathematics that we now take for granted that for any precise mathematical statement we want to make, there exists a formal sentence $S$ in the first-order language of set theory with the property that any mathematically acceptable proof of the original mathematical statement can be mimicked to produce a formal proof of $S$ from the axioms of ZFC.  And if you had any lingering doubts about whether this formal mimicry existed only in theory and not in practice, then in recent years, the advent of formal theorem-proving software such as Mizar, HOL Light, Coq, Isabelle, etc., should have swept away such doubts by demonstrating concretely that large areas of mathematics can be mimicked formally in practice, and not just in theory.\nFinally, let me mention that although I believe it is very reasonable to accept the Key Assumption, it is possible to reject it.  Perhaps most notably, the philosopher Michael Detlefsen has challenged the standard claim that the string Con(ZFC) properly mimics the statement \"ZFC is consistent\" in the sense of the Key Assumption, and has suggested that Hilbert's program to prove the consistency of mathematics is not yet dead.  I believe that Detlefsen is simply mistaken and that there is nothing unsatisfactory about the standard string Con(ZFC), but he is at least correct that there is something to be checked here, and it is not a purely mathematical point but a partially philosophical one.", "meta": {"post_id": 22635, "input_score": 36, "output_score": 52, "post_title": "Can we prove set theory is consistent?"}}
{"input": "It is well known that Feynman integrals are one of the tools that physicists have and mathematicians haven't, sadly.\n Arguably, they are the most important such tool. Briefly, the question I'd like to ask is this: what are the existing proposals for defining Feynman integrals rigorously and why don't they work?\nI should admit that my interest in all of this comes from attempts to understand Witten's definition of invariants of links in 3-manifolds (Comm Math Phys 121, 1989).\nHere are some comments on some of the existing approaches and a few specific questions. (And please let me know if I've missed any important points!)\nHere is a general framework. Suppose $E$ is a topological vector space of some kind and $L,f:E\\to\\mathbf{R}$ are functions. These are usually assumed continuous and moreover $L$ is (in all examples I know of) a polynomial of degree $\\leq d$ ($d$ is fixed) when restricted on each finite-dimensional subspace. The Feynman integral is $$Z=\\int_E e^{i L(x)}f(x) dx$$ where $dx$ is the (non-existent) translation-invariant measure on $E$ (the Feynman measure).\nThe way I understand it, this supposed to make sense since $L$ is assumed to increase sufficiently fast (at least, on the \"most\" of $E$) so that the integral becomes wildly oscillating and the contributions of most points cancel out.\nThe above is not the most general setup. In some of the most interesting applications there is a group $G$ (the gauge group) acting on $E$. The action preserves $L$ and $f$ and then what one really integrates along is the orbit space $E/G$, but still the \"integration measure\" on $E/G$ is supposed to come from the Feynman measure on $E$. Moreover, there is a way (called Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing) to write the resulting integral as an integral over $E'$ where $E'$ is a $\\mathbf{Z}/2$-graded vector space (a super vector space), which is the direct sum $E\\oplus E_{odd}$ with $E$ sitting in degree $0$ and $E_{odd}$ in degree 1.\nThere are two naive approaches to Feynman integrals -- finite-dimensional approximations and analytic continuation. Both are discussed in S. Albeverio, R. Hoegh-Krohn, S. Mazzucchi, Mathematical theory of Feynman path integrals, Springer LNM 523, 2 ed. As far as I understand, both work fine as long as $L$ is a non-degenerate quadratic function plus a bounded one. Moreover, in the 1st edition of the above-mentioned book Albeverio and Hoegh-Krohn give yet another definition, which works under the same hypotheses. \nHowever, one can try to do e.g. finite dimensional approximations for any $L$ (and probably renormalize as divergencies occur). So here is the first naive question: has anyone tried to find out what are the functions $L$ for which this procedure can be carried out and leads to sensible results?\nSince it is so difficult to define Feynman integrals directly, people have resorted to various tricks. For example, suppose $0$ is a non-denenerate critical point of $L$, so $L$ can be written $L(x)=Q(x)+U(x)$ where $Q$ is a non-degenerate quadratic function and $U$ is formed by the higher order terms. Introducing a parameter $h$ one can write (in finite dimensions and for a sufficiently nice $U$) the Taylor series for $\\int_E e^{i (Q(x)+hU(x))}f(x) dx$ at $h=0$ in terms of Feynman diagrams. This is explained in e.g. in section 2 of the paper \"Feynman integrals for pedestrians\" by M. Polyak, arXiv:math/0406251. When one tries to mimic this in infinite dimensions, one runs into difficulties: the coefficients of Feynman diagrams are given by finite-dimensional but divergent integrals (e.g. if $E$ is the space of functions of some kind on some manifold, then the integrals are taken along the configuration spaces of that manifold).\nA. Connes and D. Kreimer have proposed a systematic way to get rid of the divergencies (Renormalization in quantum field theory and the Riemann-Hilbert problem I: the Hopf algebra structure of graphs and the main theorem, arXiv:hep-th/9912092). I think I understand how it works in the particular case of the Chern-Simons theory, but I was never able to understand the details of the above paper. In particular, I'd like to ask: what are precisely the conditions on $Q$ and $U$ in order for this procedure to be applicable? What happens when we take the resulting series in $h$? If it diverges, is it still possible to deduce the value of the Feynman integral from it when the latter can be computed by other means (as it is the case e.g. with the Chern-Simons theory on a 3-manifold)?\nFinally, let me mention yet another approach to Feynman integrals: the \"white noise analysis\" (see e.g. Lectures on White noise functionals by T. Hida and S. Si). It was used by S. Albeverio and A. Sengupta (Comm Math Phys, 186, 1997) to define rigorously the Chern-Simons integrals when the ambient manifold is $\\mathbf{R}^3$ (they have to use gauge-fixing though). Since I don't know much about this I'd like to ask a couple of naive questions: Is there a way this could help one handle the cases other approaches can't? Can this help eliminate the necessity to start with a non-degenerate quadratic function?", "output": "Most of this is standard theory of path integrals known to mathematical physicists so I will try to address all of your questions.  \nFirst let me say that the hypothesis you list for the action $S$ to make the path integral well defined, ie that $S=Q+V$ where $Q$ is quadratic and non-degenerate and $V$ is bounded are extremely restrictive.  One should think of $V$ as defining the potential energy for interactions of the physical system and while it certainly true that one expects this to be bounded below, there are very few physical systems where this is also bounded above (this is also true for interesting mathematical applications...).  Essentially requiring that the potential be bounded implies that the asymptotic behavior of $S$ in the configuration space is totally controlled by the quadratic piece.  Since path integrals with quadratic actions are trivial to define and evaluate, it is not really that surprising or interesting that by bounding the potential one can make the integral well behaved.    \nNext you ask if anyone has studied the question of when an action $S$ gives rise to a well defined path integral: $ \\int \\mathcal{D}f \\ e^{-S[f(x)]}$\nThe answer of course is yes. The people who come to mind first are Glimm and Jaffe who have made whole careers studying this issue.  In all cases of interest $S$ is an integral $S=\\int L$ where the integral is over your spacetime manifold $M$ (in the simplest case $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$) and the problem is to constrain $L$.  The problem remains unsolved but nevertheless there are some existence proofs.  The basic example is a scalar field theory, ie we are trying to integrate over a space of maps $\\phi: M \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$.  We take an $L$ of the form:\n$ L = -\\phi\\Delta \\phi +P(\\phi)$\nWhere in the above $\\Delta$ is the Laplacian, and $P$ a polynomial.  The main nontrivial result is then that if $M$ is three dimensional, and $P$ is bounded below with degree less than seven then the functional integral exists rigorously.  Extending this analysis to the case where $M$ has dimension four is a major unsolved problem.\nMoving on to your next point, you ask about another approach to path integrals called perturbation theory.  The typical example here is when the action is of the form $S= Q+\\lambda V$ where $Q$ is quadratic, $V$ is not, and $\\lambda$ is a parameter.  We attempt a series expansion in $\\lambda$.  The first thing to say here, and this is very important, is that in doing this expansion I am not attempting to define the functional integral by its series expansion, rather I am attempting to approximate it by a series.  Let me give an example of the difference.  Consider the following function $f(\\lambda)$:\n$f(\\lambda)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx  \\ e^{-x^{2}-\\lambda x^{4}}$ \nThe function $f$ is manifestly non-analytic in $\\lambda$ at $\\lambda=0$.  Indeed if $\\lambda<0$ the integral diverges, while if $\\lambda \\geq 0$ the integral converges.  Nevertheless we can still be rash and attempt to define a series expansion of $f$ in powers of $\\lambda$ by expanding the exponential and then interchanging the order of summation and integration (illegal to be sure!).  We arrive at a formal series:\n$s(\\lambda)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{n}}{n!}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}dx  \\ e^{-x^{2}}(-x^{4})^{n}$\nOf course this series diverges.  However this expansion was not in vain.  $s(\\lambda)$ is a basic example of an asymptotic series.  For small $\\lambda$ truncating the series at finite order less than $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^{2}}$ gives an excellent approximation to the function $f(\\lambda)$\nReturning to the example of Feynman integrals, the first point is that the perturbation expansion in $\\lambda$ is an asymptotic series not a Taylor series.  Thus just as for $s(\\lambda)$ it is misguided to ask if the series converges...we already know that it does not!  A better question is to ask for which actions $S$ this approximation scheme of perturbation theory itself exists.  On this issue there is a complete and rigorous answer worked out by mathematical physicists in the late 70s and 80s called renormalization theory.  A good reference is the book by Collins \"Renormalization.\"  Connes and Kreimer have not added new results here; rather they have given modern proofs of these results using Hopf algebras etc.\nFinally I will hopefully answer some of your questions about Chern-Simons theory. The basic point is that Chern-Simons theory is a topological field theory.  This means that it suffers from none of the difficulties of usual path integrals.  In particular all quantities we want to compute can be reduced to finite dimensional integrals which are of course well defined.  Of course since we lack an independent definition of the Feynman integral over the space of connections, the argument demonstrating that it reduces to a finite dimensional integral is purely formal.  However we can simply take the finite dimensional integrals as the definition of the theory.  A good expository account of this work can be found in the recent paper of Beasley \"Localization for Wilson Loops in Chern-Simons Theory.\"\nOverall I would say that by far the currently most developed approach to studying path integrals rigorously is that of discretization.  One approximates spacetime by a lattice of points and the path integral by a regular integral at each lattice site.  The hard step is to prove that the limit as the lattice spacing $ a  $ goes to zero, the so-called continuum limit, exists.  This is a very hard analysis problem.  Glimm and Jaffe succeeded in using this method to construct the examples I mentioned above, but their arguments appear limited.  Schematically when we take the limit of zero lattice size we also need to take a limit of our action, in other words the action should be a function of $ a$.  We now write $S(a)=Q+\\lambda V+H(a,\\lambda)$  Where as usual $Q$ is quadratic $V$ is not an $\\lambda$ is a parameter. Our original action is $S=Q +\\lambda V$ \nThe question is then can we find an $H(a,\\lambda)$ such that a suitable $a\\rightarrow 0$ limit exists?  A priori one could try any $H$ however the arguments of Glimm and Jaffe are limited to the case where $H$ is polynomial in $\\lambda$.  Physically this means that the theory is very insensitive to short distance effects, in other words one could modify the interactions slightly at short distances and one would find essentially the same long distance physics.  It seems that new methods are needed to generalize to a larger class of continuum limits.", "meta": {"post_id": 24823, "input_score": 92, "output_score": 53, "post_title": "The mathematical theory of Feynman integrals"}}

Thus, under AC, the $\\aleph_\\alpha$'s form all of the possible infinite cardinalities. \nBut when AC fails, the cardinalities are not linearly ordered (the linearity of cardinalities is equivalent to AC). Let me mention a few examples:\n\nIt is a consequence of the Axiom of Determinacy that there is no $\\omega_1$ sequence of distinct reals. Thus, in any model of AD, the cardinality of the reals is uncountable, but incomparable to $\\aleph_1$. Thus, in such a model, it is no longer correct to say that $\\aleph_1$ is the smallest uncountable cardinal. One should say instead that $\\aleph_1$ is the smallest uncountable well-orderable cardinal.\nA more extreme example is provided by the Dedekind finite infinite sets. These sets are not finite, but also not bijective with any proper subset. It follows that they can have no countably infinite subsets. In particular, they are uncountable sets, but their cardinality is incomparable with $\\omega$. Thus, in a model of $\\neg AC$ having a Dedekind finite infinite set, it is no longer correct to say that $\\aleph_0$ is the smallest infinite cardinal. \n\nThus, the issue isn't whether there is something between $\\aleph_0$ and $\\aleph_1$, but rather, whether there are additional cardinalities to the side of these cardinalities.", "meta": {"post_id": 25132, "input_score": 8, "output_score": 42, "post_title": "Cardinality: Why is there no \"\u2135\u00bd\"?"}}

Apparently a Variational Crime is an approach to solve problems using a finite element method (e.g. Galerkin) where certain assumptions about approximate solutions are violated. As you can see, even after doing a brief search in the literature my understanding of the \"problem\" is still rather superficial and limited (and very possibly wrong). \nSo, my questions are\n\nCan someone give me a quick and dirty explanation of what Variational Crimes is about (and how it is useful)?\nDoes anyone know where the name comes from?\n\nThis is just out of curiosity into what other people are doing; I am by no means a numerical analyst.", "output": "Thanks for your interest in the paper!  (It's also nice to see something on Math Overflow that I know something about.)  Your summary of variational crimes is actually pretty close to the mark: it refers to certain \"abuses\" of the Galerkin method, where some of the assumptions are violated, and thus the standard error estimates (e.g., C\u00e9a's lemma) are no longer valid.\nSince you have the basic idea right, let me try to provide some context and motivation.  As a simple example, consider Poisson's equation on some domain $ U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n $ with Dirichlet boundary conditions,\n$$ - \\Delta u = f \\text{ on } U, \\quad u \\rvert _{\\partial U} = 0 .$$  \nThis can be written as a variational problem on $ V = \\{ v \\in H^1(U) : v \\rvert_{\\partial U} = 0 \\} $: Find $ u \\in V $ such that\n$$ \\int _U \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\; dx = \\int _U f \\thinspace v \\; dx , \\quad \\forall v \\in V .$$\n(You can see, using integration by parts, that any classical solution solves this variational problem.)  If we define the bilinear form $ B(u,v) = \\int _U \\nabla u \\cdot \\nabla v \\; dx $ and functional $ F(v) = \\int _U \\thinspace f \\thinspace v \\; dx $, then this problem can be written in the usual abstract form: Find $ u \\in V $ such that\n$$ B(u,v) = F(v) ,\\quad \\forall v \\in V .$$\nTo apply the Galerkin method, we need to take a subspace $ V _h \\subset V $ (e.g., the span of some finite element basis) and solve the Galerkin variational problem: Find $ u _h \\in V _h $ such that \n$$ B(u_h, v ) = F(v), \\quad \\forall v \\in V_h .$$\nThe problem is that, for many practical purposes, this is impossible to compute.  First, the bilinear form $ B(\\cdot, \\cdot) $ requires us to calculate an integral exactly.  In practice, this is usually not possible, so people instead approximate the integral using numerical quadrature.  However, this is a variational crime, since using numerical quadrature replaces $ B (\\cdot, \\cdot) $ by some $ B_h (\\cdot, \\cdot) \\approx B(\\cdot, \\cdot) $ in the Galerkin variational principle; likewise, numerical quadrature also replaces $ F(\\cdot) $ by some $ F_h(\\cdot) \\approx F(\\cdot) $.  (This is aside from the fact that computers only use finite-precision arithmetic, so even if we had an closed formula for these integrals, there would always be some floating-point error involved.)\nMoreover, if $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n $ is polyhedral, then it can be triangulated exactly, so we can get $ V_h \\subset V $ to be some finite element space supported on this piecewise-linear mesh.  However, if $U$ has a curved boundary, then a piecewise-linear (or piecewise-polynomial, in the case of isoparametric elements) mesh only approximates the actual domain.  Since the functions in $ V_h$ are defined on a slightly different domain than those in $V$, in this case $ V_h \\not\\subset V $.\nNow, in the real world of numerical computation (engineering, etc.), people didn't worry too much about using these approximations instead of the exact Galerkin variational problem; it was a practical necessity, and the approximations seemed to converge just fine.  However, these \"variational crimes\" meant that the abstract Galerkin error analysis was no longer valid for the modified methods.  Strang pointed this out, and his lemmas quantify the additional errors introduced by these \"crimes.\"\nAs far as the history/terminology: to the best of my knowledge, Strang himself coined the term \"variational crime.\"  The earliest reference I know is \n[Strang, G. (1972), Variational crimes in the finite element method. In The mathematical foundations of the finite element method with applications to partial differential equations (Proc. Sympos., Univ. Maryland, Baltimore, Md., 1972), pages 689\u2013710. Academic Press, New York.], although I haven't been able to find an electronic copy.

The idea is to pretend\nthat $\\frac{1}{1 - ba}$ can be expanded in a geometric series (which\nis utter nonsense), so that\n$(1 - ba)^{-1} = 1 + ba + baba + bababa + \\cdots$\nIt follows (it doesn't really, but it's fun to keep pretending) that\n$(1 - ba)^{-1} = 1 + b (1 + ab + abab + ababab + \\cdots) a.$\nand, after one more application of the geometric series\npretense, this yields\n$(1 -ba)^{-1} = 1 + b (1 - ab)^{-1} a.$\nNow stop the pretense and verify that, despite its unlawful\nderivation, the formula works. If, that is, $ c = (1 - ab)^{-1}$, \nso that $(1 - ab)c = c(1 - ab) = 1,$ then $1 + bca$ is the inverse\nof $1 - ba.$ Once the statement is put this way, its\nproof becomes a matter of (perfectly legal) mechanical\ncomputation.\nWhy does it all this work? What goes on here? Why\ndoes it seem that the formula for the sum of an infinite\ngeometric series is true even for an abstract ring in which\nconvergence is meaningless?

{"input": "A few months ago there were several math talks about how the Lie group E8 had been detected in some physics experiment.

The evidence for the detection of E8 appears to be that they found a couple of peaks in some experiment, at points whose ratio is close to the golden ratio, which is apparently a prediction of some paper that I have not yet tracked down. The peaks are quite fuzzy and all one can really say is that their ratio is somewhere around 1.6. This seems to me to be a rather weak reason for claiming detection of a 248 dimensional Lie group; I would guess that a significant percentage of all experimental physics papers have a pair of peaks looking somewhat like this.\nDoes anyone know enough about the physics to comment on whether the claim is plausible? Or has anyone heard anything more about this from a reliable source? (Most of what I found with google consisted of uninformed blogs and journalists quoting each other.)\nUpdate added later: I had a look at the paper mentioned by  Willie Wong below, where Zamoldchikov predicts the expected masses. In fact he predicts there should be 8 peaks, and while the experimental results are consistent with the first 2 peaks, there are no signs of any of the other peaks. My feeling is that the interpretation of the experimental results as confirmation of an E8 symmetry is somewhat overenthusiastic.", "output": "This is a great question, but I don't think a reasonable answer can be given in this short space.  So I wrote an expository note jointly with a colleague who was trained as a physicist.  You can read it by following the link above -- comments are welcome.\nBut here are a couple of highlights:\n\n It's not true that they measured this one number, and so claimed to have detected E8.*  There is a bit more data than that.  And there is a lot more history!  Back around 1990, there was a series of theoretical \"deductions\" (in the weak sense of physics) investigating what the appropriate theoretical model should be for the situation in the magnet experiment.  This led to a unique candidate for a model, one built out of E8.  I would say that the experiment corroborated the series of deductions, with the sensational bonus that the deductions led to E8.\n\n Which E8 appears in the theoretical model?  The obvious answer is that it is the compact real E8 and not just the root system or root lattice.  For example, even though the masses of the 8 particles are given as entries in an eigenvector for the Cartan matrix (which makes it sound like it's just the root system), the proof of this statement is a calculation within the compact Lie algebra.\n\nOne can argue about both of these points, of course.  But these seem to be what the physicists claim and what they use in their papers.\n\nTo address Wadim's concerns about fringe science: Whether or not you find the E8 angle interesting or plausible, it seems that the experiment is interesting for entirely different reasons.  The experimenters themselves claim that their main achievement is realizing this 1-dimensional quantum Ising model in the laboratory in a situation where the external field can be tuned to be above, below, or at the critical point.  The Physics Today article on the subject paraphrases Subir Sachdev: \n\nonly recently could researchers reach\n  the high fields and low temperatures\n  needed to access the critical point\n  and have high enough instrumental\n  resolution to resolve the masses of at\n  least some of the quasiparticles\n  they excited.

{"input": "Question \nSuppose there is a bijection between the underlying sets of two finite groups $G, H$, such that every subgroup of $G$ corresponds to a subgroup of $H$, and that every subgroup of $H$ corresponds to a subgroup of $G$. Does this imply that $G, H$ are isomorphic? Note that we do not require the bijection to actually be the isomorphism.\n Motivation \nThe question is interesting to me because I am considering maps of groups which aren't homomorphisms but preserve the subgroup structure in some sense - given a group, we can forget the multiplication operation and look only at the closure operator that maps a subset of $G$ to the subgroup generated by it. If the question is resolved in the affirmative, then the forgetful functor from the usual category $Grp$ to this category won't create any new isomorphisms. (Note that I didn't precisely specify the morphisms this new category -- you could just use the usual definition of a homomorphism, and say that if the mapping commutes with the closure operator, then its a morphism. The definition I actually care about is, a morphism of this category is a mapping such that every closed set in the source object is the preimage of a closed set of the target object. It doesn't make much difference as far as this question is concerned, the isomorphisms of both categories are the same.)\nI asked a friend at Mathcamp about this a few weeks ago, he said a bunch of people started thinking about it but got stumped after a while. The consensus seems to have been that it is probably false, but the only counter examples may be very large. I don't really have any good ideas / tools for how to prove it might be true, I mostly wanted to just ask if anyone knew offhand / had good intuition for how to find a finite counterexample. \n\nEdit (YCor): (a) the question has reappeared in the following formulation: does the hypergraph structure of the set of subgroups of a (finite) group determine its isomorphism type? A hypergraph is a set endowed with a set of subsets. The hypergraph of subgroups is the data of the set of subgroups, and therefore to say that groups $G,H$ have isomorphic hypergraphs of subgroups means that there's a bijection $f:G\\to H$ such that for every subset $A\\subset G$, $f(A)$ is a subgroup of $H$ if and only $A$ is a subgroup of $G$. Several answers, complementing the one given here, have been provided in this question.\n(b) There a weaker well-studied notion for groups, namely to have isomorphic subgroup lattices. Having isomorphic hypergraphs of subgroups requires such an isomorphism to be implemented by a bijection (this is not always the case: take two groups of distinct prime order).", "output": "The answer is no in general. I.e, there are finite non-isomorphic groups G and H such that there exists a bijection between their elements which also induces a bijection between their subgroups.\nFor this, I used two non-isomorphic groups which not only have the same subgroup lattice (which certainly is necessary), but also have the same conjugacy classes. There are two such groups of size 605, both a semidirect product $(C_{11}\\times C_{11}) \\rtimes C_5$ (see this site for details on the construction). In the small group library of GAP, these are the groups with id [ 605, 5 ] and. [ 605, 6 ]. These are provably non-isomorphic (you can construct the groups as described in the reference I gave, and then use GAPs IdSmallGroup command to verify that the groups described there are the same as the ones I am working with here). With a short computer program, one can now construct a suitable bijection.\nFirst, let us take the two groups:\ngap> G:=SmallGroup(605, 5);    \n<pc group of size 605 with 3 generators>\ngap> H:=SmallGroup(605, 6);\n<pc group of size 605 with 3 generators>\n\nThe elements of these groups are of order 1, 5 or 11, and there are 1, 484 and 120 of each. We will sort them in a \"nice\" way (that is, we try to match each subgroup of order 5 to another one, element by element) and obtain a bijection from this. First, a helper function to give us all elements in \"nice\" order:\nElementsInNiceOrder := function (K)\n    local elts, cc;\n    elts := [ One(K) ];\n    cc := ConjugacyClassSubgroups(K, Group(K.1));\n    Append(elts, Concatenation(List(cc, g -> Filtered(g,h->Order(h)=5))));\n    Append(elts, Filtered(Group(K.2, K.3), g -> Order(g)=11));\n    return elts;\nend;;\n\nNow we can take the elements in the nice order and define the bijection $f$:\ngap> Gelts := ElementsInNiceOrder(G);;\ngap> Helts := ElementsInNiceOrder(H);;\ngap> f := g -> Helts[Position(Gelts, g)];;\n\nFinally, we compute the sets of all subgroups of $G$ resp. $H$, and verify that $f$ induces a bijection between them:\ngap> Gsubs := Union(ConjugacyClassesSubgroups(G));;          \ngap> Hsubs := Union(ConjugacyClassesSubgroups(H));;\ngap> Set(Gsubs, g -> Group(List(g, f))) = Hsubs;\ntrue\n\nThus we have established the claim with help of a computer algebra system. From this, one could now obtain a pen & paper proof for the claim, if one desires so. I have not done this in full detail, but here are some hints.\nSay $G$ is generated by three generators $g_1,g_2,g_3$, where $g_1$ generates the $C_5$ factor and $g_2,g_3$ generate the characteristic subgroup $C_{11}\\times C_{11}$. We choose a similar generating set $h_1,h_2,h_3$ for $H$. We now define $f$ in two steps: First, for $0\\leq n,m <11$ it shall map $g_2^n g_3^m$ to $h_2^n h_3^m$. \nThis covers all elements of order 1 or 11, so in step two we specify how to map the remaining elements, which all have order 5. These are split into four conjugacy classes: $g_1^G$, $(g_1^2)^G$, $(g_1^3)^G$ and $(g_1^4)^G$. We fix any bijection between $g_1^G$ and $h_1^H$ and extend that to a bijection on all elements of order 5 by the rule $f((g_1^g)^n)=f(g_1^g)^n$. With some effort, one can now verify that this is a well-defined bijection between $G$ and $H$ with the desired properties. You will need to determine the subgroup lattice in each case; linear algebra helps a bit, as well as the fact that all subgroups have order 1, 5, 11, 55, 121 (unique) or 605. I'll leave the details to the reader, as I myself am happy enough with the computer result. \nUPDATE: as pointed out in another answer below by @dvitek (explained by @Ian Agol in comments), there is actually a much simpler example, which I somehow overlooked when I did my computer search.

Perhaps you mean a quasi-projective variety (=reduced and of finite type) defined over some (algebraically closed) field.\nOK, let's assume that $X$ is such a variety. Then what is a divisor on $X$? Of course, you could just say it is a formal linear combination of prime divisors, where a prime divisor is just a codimension 1 irreducible subvariety. \nOK, but what if $X$ is not equidimensional? Well, let's assume it is, or even that it is irreducible. \nStill, if you want to talk about divisors, you would surely want to say when two divisors are linearly equivalent. OK, we know what that is, $D_1$ and $D_2$ are linearly equivalent iff $D_1-D_2$ is a principal divisor.\nBut, what is a principal divisor? Here it starts to become clear why one usually assumes that $X$ is normal even to just talk about divisors, let alone defining the canonical divisor. In order to define principal divisors, one would need to define something like the order of vanishing of a regular function along a prime divisor. It's not obvious how to define this unless the local ring of the general point of any prime divisor is a DVR. Well, then this leads to one to want to assume that $X$ is $R_1$, that is, regular in codimension $1$ which is equivalent to those local rings being DVRs.\nOK, now once we have this we might also want another property: If $f$ is a regular function, we would expect, that the zero set of $f$ should be 1-codimensional in $X$. In other words, we would expect that if $Z\\subset X$ is a closed subset of codimension at least $2$, then if  $f$ is nowhere zero on $X\\setminus Z$, then it is nowhere zero on $X$. In (yet) other words, if $1/f$ is a regular function on $X\\setminus Z$, then we expect that it is a regular function on $X$. This in the language of sheaves means that we expect that the push-forward of $\\mathscr O_{X\\setminus Z}$ to $X$ is isomorphic to $\\mathscr O_X$. Now this is essentially equivalent to $X$ being $S_2$.\nSo we get that in order to define divisors as we are used to them, we would need that $X$ be $R_1$ and $S_2$, that is, normal. \nNow, actually, one can work with objects that behave very much like divisors even on non-normal varieties/schemes, but one has to be very careful what properties work for them.\nAs far as I can tell, the best way is to work with Weil divisorial sheaves which are really reflexive sheaves of rank $1$. On a normal variety, the sheaf associated to a Weil divisor $D$, usually denoted by $\\mathcal O_X(D)$, is indeed a reflexive sheaf of rank $1$, and conversely every reflexive sheaf of rank $1$ on a normal variety is the sheaf associated to a Weil divisor (in particular a reflexive sheaf of rank $1$ on a regular variety is an invertible sheaf) so this is indeed a direct generalization. One word of caution here: $\\mathcal O_X(D)$ may be defined for Weil divisors that are not Cartier, but then this is (obviously) not an invertible sheaf.\nFinally, to answer your original question about canonical divisors. Indeed it is possible to define a canonical divisor (=Weil divisorial sheaf) for all quasi-projective varieties. If $X\\subseteq \\mathbb P^N$ and $\\overline X$ denotes the closure of $X$ in $\\mathbb P^N$, then the dualizing complex of $\\overline X$ is \n$$\n\\omega_{\\overline X}^\\bullet=R{\\mathscr H}om_{\\mathbb P^N}(\\mathscr O_{\\overline X}, \\omega_{\\mathbb P^N}[N])\n$$\nand the canonical sheaf of $X$ is\n$$\n\\omega_X=h^{-n}(\\omega_{\\overline X}^\\bullet)|_X=\\mathscr Ext^{N-n}_{\\mathbb P^N}(\\mathscr O_{\\overline X},\\omega_{\\mathbb P^N})|_X\n$$ \nwhere $n=\\dim X$. (Notice that you may disregard the derived category stuff and the dualizing complex, and just make the definition using $\\mathscr Ext$.)  Notice further, that \nif $X$ is normal, this is the same as the one you are used to and otherwise it is a reflexive sheaf of rank $1$.\nAs for your formula, I am not entirely sure what you mean by \"where the $D_i$ are representatives of all divisors in the Class Group\".

The lesson to learn from Giraud is that really one does not use groups for coefficients of higher cohomology. For a start, Giraud's $H^2(X,G)$ is not functorial with respect to group homomorphisms $G\\to H$! One also does not get the exact sequences that one expects (this is due to the lack of functoriality). But this is not a problem with his definition of the cohomology set, but a problem with what category you believe the coefficients lie in. This is because the coefficient object of Giraud's cohomology is actually the crossed module $AUT(G) = (G \\to Aut(G))$, and the assignment $G \\mapsto AUT(G)$ is not functorial. (Aside: Giraud contains lots of other important things on stacks and gerbes and sites and so on, so the book is not a waste of time by any means)\nBut little-known work by Debremaeker[1-3] from the 1970s fixed this up and showed that really the Giraud cohomology was functorial with respect to morphisms of crossed modules. This has been recently extended by Aldrovandi and Noohi [4] by showing that it is functorial with respect to weak maps of crossed modules aka butterflies/papillion.\nIt was realised by John E. Roberts (no relation) and Ross Street that the most general nonabelian cohomology has as coefficient objects higher categories. In fact, we now know that the coefficients of $n^{th}$ degree cohomology is an $n$-category (usually an $n$-groupoid, though), even when we are talking about usual abelian cohomology.\nEverything I've talked about is just for groups etc in Set, but it can all be done internal to a topos, i.e. for sheaves of groups, and more generally a Barr-exact category (and probably weaker, but Barr-exact means that the monadic description of cohomology therein due to Duskin (probably going back to Beck) works fine).\n\n[0] R.

That question is here, and it contains additional links, which I doubt I can embed here because I don't have enough reputation.  Anyway, here goes:\nObjective: Settle the conjecture that there is no projective plane of order 12.\nIn 1989, using computer search on a Cray, Lam proved that no projective plane of order 10 exists. Now that God's Number for Rubik's Cube has been determined after just a few weeks of massive brute force search (plus clever math of symmetry), it seems to me that this longstanding open problem might be within reach.  I'm hoping this question can serve as a sanity check.\nThe Cube was solved by reducing the total problem size to \"only\" 2,217,093,120 distinct tests, which could be run in parallel.\nQuestions:\n\nThere have been special cases of nonexistence shown (again, by computer search). Does anyone know, if we remove those and exhaustively (cleverly?) search the rest, if the problem size is on the order of the Cube search? (Maybe too much to hope for that someone knows this....)\nAny partial information in this vein?", "output": "I am actually not aware of many results on planes of order 12 in the vein of what Lam et. al. did (I list the few I know of below). There seems to be a plethora of papers proving restrictions on the collineation group of a hypothetical such plane, but I am not aware of how any of these could be used to settle the existence problem.\nMoreover, I am quite skeptical that disproving the existence of planes of order 12 by a computer search would help for the general theory much. Though it certainly would be nice to know, and if one actually found a plane of order 12, that would be quite exciting; but it's hard to gain deep insights from these combinatorial brute force searches.\nExtending the approach by Lam et. al. to planes of order 12 is in principle possible. But probably still not feasible with today's computers, as the search space is a lot bigger than for order 10. Anyway, here are some reasons why I think that, and at the same time a sketch of things that would have to be done. But my personal belief is that one will need some substantially new ideas to make progress on this. Then again, only by actually trying to do it can one be sure... :)\nFrom here on, I'll assume you are familiar with Lam's \"The Search for a Finite Projective Plane of Order 10\" and the notation used within.\nA crucial point was the reduction of the (non-)existence to the value of certain weight enumerator coefficients $w_0$ to $w_{n^2+n+1}$ (a good exposition can be found in \"On the existence of a projective plane of order 10\" by MacWilliams, Sloane and Thompson). But the real breakthrough was when Assmus and Mattson proved that one only needs to know $w_{12},w_{15},w_{16}$ to determine all others. I'll refer to these as essential weight enumerator coefficients.\nSome steps towards this for order 12 have been executed in \"Ternary and binary codes for a plane of order $12$\" by Hall and Wilkinson. Yet many nice properties and theorems will be hard to recover for order 12. E.g. for orders of the form $8m+2$, one knows the $\\mathbb{F}_2$-rank of the incidence matrix. Not so for order 12, where working with a ternary code is in some ways more \"natural.\" In particular, the $\\mathbb{F}_3$-rank of the incidence matrix is known, but, alas, working with a ternary code means losing the natural identification of codewords with point sets, so tons of new machinery would be needed to exploit the ternary code.  Thus I'll focus on the binary code case here.\nAnyway, let's assume we reduced the number of essential weight enumerator coefficients as much as we can (Hall and Wilkinson pushed it down to 16; remember, for $n=10$ we had only 3). We must compute the essential coefficients.\nAccording to Lam, for $n=10$ and the case $w_{12}$, they estimated, using a Monte-Carlo method (before doing it) that $4\\times 10^{11}$ configuration had to be checked. I don't have a good means to compute a good estimate for $n=12$, but for that there are 16 coefficients to determine, and I'd hazard to guess that some of them are much, much harder than the three cases for $n=10$ put together. Several orders of magnitude. However, this is just gut feeling.\nSo let's assume we had somehow managed to overcome this and had computed all essential weight enumerator coefficients. We then would have the full weight enumerator at hand (and no projective plane arose as a byproduct of our search). Now, the hard part starts (corresponding roughly to the second half of Lam's paper), the one that took them 2 years for $n=10$: We have to somehow derive a contradiction (or construct a plane). A lot of ground work needs to be done (extending stuff from $n=10$), before one can even start writing code...\nAh well. To anybody who wants to try out this strategy on $n=12$, I would recommend to first try reproducing the $n=10$ result -- with modern computers it should be possible to do this much, much quicker than it took Lam et. al. originally (this verification might already interest some people on its own). Actually, at the very start, try it with even smaller examples ($n=6,8$), then go up.\nUPDATE 2023-08-10: I just learned that the $n=10$ result has been reproduced not once but twice in the meantime:\n\nin 2010/2011 by Dominique J.

Third, they upper-bound the probability of a \"bad event\" by 1/n0.1, whereas we'd like to upper-bound it by 1/p(n) for any polynomial p.\n\nThe numerical evidence that we've obtained is strongly consistent with our conjecture being true (see figure below).\n\nWe can prove that our conjecture holds with the determinant in place of the permanent.  To do so, we use the fact that if X is Gaussian, then because of the rotational invariance of the Gaussian measure, there's an explicit formula for all the moments of Det(X) -- even the fractional and inverse moments.\n\nOne might wonder if we can also calculate the higher moments of Per(X), and use that to prove our conjecture.  Indeed, we can show that $\\operatorname*{E}_{X\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  0,1\\right)  _{\\mathbb{C}}^{n\\times n}}\\left[  \\left\\vert \\operatorname*{Per}\\left(  X\\right)\\right\\vert ^{4}\\right]  =\\left(  n!\\right)  ^{2}\\left(  n+1\\right)$, which then implies the following weak anti-concentration bound: for all \u03b2<1, $\\Pr_{X\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(  0,1\\right)  _{\\mathbb{C}}^{n\\times n}}\\left[  \\left\\vert \\operatorname*{Per}\\left(  X\\right)  \\right\\vert \\geq\n\\beta\\sqrt{n!}\\right]  \\geq\\frac{\\left(  1-\\beta^{2}\\right)  ^{2}}{n+1}$.  Unfortunately, computing the 6th, 8th, and higher moments seems difficult.\n\nSee section 8 of our paper for the proofs of 4 and 5.\nShort of proving our anti-concentration conjecture, here are two easier questions whose answers would also greatly interest us:\n\nCan we at least reprove Tao and Vu's bound for Gaussian matrices rather than Bernoulli matrices?  In their paper, Tao and Vu say their result holds for \"virtually any (not too degenerate) discrete distribution.\"  I don't think the Gaussian distribution would present serious new difficulties, but I'm not sure.\nDoes the pdf of Per(X) diverge at the origin?  (We don't even know the answer to that question in the case of Det(X).)  I don't know of any formal implications between this question and the anti-concentration question, but it would be great to answer anyway.\n\n (source: Wayback Machine)", "output": "I did a preliminary feasibility analysis of our methods and it appears possible that one may be able to tighten our $n^\\epsilon$ loss to something more like $\\exp( \\sqrt{n} )$ in the Gaussian case, but this is still well short of what you want.  The main obstacle is potential coupling between permanents of minors, which we were not able to fully avoid.\nHere's the heuristic calculation.  Suppose that a Gaussian $k \\times k$ permanent has some distribution $P_k$.  Then a Gaussian $k+1 \\times k+1$ permanent $P_{k+1}$, by cofactor expansion, looks like\n$$ P_{k+1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} (-1)^i x_i P_k^{(i)}$$\nwhere $x_i$ are iid Gaussians and the $P_k^{(i)}$ are copies of $P_k$ corresponding to various $k \\times k$ minors of the $k+1 \\times k+1$ matrix.\nAs the entries of the $k+1 \\times k+1$ matrix are iid, the $x_i$ are independent of the $P_k^{(i)}$, and so for fixed values of $P_k^{(i)}$, we see that $P_{k+1}$ is distributed normally with mean zero and variance $\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} |P_k^{(i)}|^2$, which we can rewrite as\n$$ P_{k+1} = (\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} |P_k^{(i)}|^2)^{1/2} \\cdot N_{k+1}\\qquad (1)$$ \nwhere $N_{k+1}$ is a standard normal random variable (independent of the $P_k^{(i)}$).\nNow we come up against the key problem: the $P_k^{(i)}$ are identically distributed, but are not jointly independent, because there is a huge amount of overlap between the $k \\times k$ minors.  So, while heuristically one expects concentration of measure to kick in and make $(\\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} |P_k^{(i)}|^2)^{1/2}$ more concentrated than any one of the $P_k^{(i)}$, we don't know how to prevent huge correlations from happening.  In the worst case, all the $P_k^{(i)}$ are perfectly correlated to each other, and then (1) could become something more like\n$$ P_{k+1} = (k+1)^{1/2} |P_k| \\cdot N_{k+1}.$$\nThis multiplicative normal process would lead to $P_n$ to concentrate between $\\sqrt{n!} \\exp(-O(\\sqrt{n}))$ and $\\sqrt{n!} \\exp(O(\\sqrt{n}))$, as can be seen by taking logs and applying the central limit theorem.\nBut this worst case can't actually be the truth - among other things, it contradicts the second moment calculation.  So there should be some way to prevent this correlation.  Unfortunately, my paper with Van completely evades this issue - we try to get as far as we can just from the obvious fact that disjoint minors are independent from each other.  This is why our bounds are significantly worse than $\\exp(O(\\sqrt{n}))$ from the truth.\nAs you say, the situation is much better for the determinant of a Gaussian iid matrix.  Here, we can use the base-times-height formula to express the determinant as a product $\\prod_{i=1}^n \\hbox{dist}(X_i,V_i)$, where $X_i$ is the $i^{th}$ row and $V_i$ is the span of the first $i-1$ rows.  With everything being Gaussian, $\\hbox{dist}(X_i,V_i)^2$ is a chi-squared distribution, which is a martingale in $i$, and as a consequence one can get the determinant within $\\exp(O(\\sqrt{\\log n}))$ of $\\sqrt{(n-1)!}$, which would give you what you want.  Unfortunately, there is nothing like the base-times-height formula for the permanent...\nFinally, I am fairly certain that at the level of $n^{-\\epsilon n}$ losses, one can replicate our paper in the Bernoulli case to the Gaussian case.  I don't think the $n^{-\\epsilon n}$ loss gets much better in that case, but the $\\frac{1}{n^{0.1}}$ bound should improve substantially.", "meta": {"post_id": 45822, "input_score": 44, "output_score": 41, "post_title": "Anti-concentration bound for permanents of Gaussian matrices?"}}

Indeed the latter answers the title question with (my bold):\n\nWe already observed (...) an analogy between the boundary operation and differentiation: Both are linear, and performed twice, both give zero:\n  $$\n\\begin{align}\nf(c_1\\pm c_2)&=fc_1\\pm fc_2,& f(fc)&=0,\\tag1\\\\\nd(\\omega_1\\pm\\omega_2)&=d\\omega_1\\pm d\\omega_2,& d(d\\omega)&=0.\\tag2\n\\end{align}\n$$\n  This analogy actually goes much further (...).

(...) Our analogy\u2019s starting point is the fact that chains, like forms, make an alternating ring (...) and to the differentiation rule for products corresponds the formula which gives the boundary of an intersection:\n  $$\nf(c_2c_1)=c_2fc_1+(-1)^{n-p}fc_2\\cdot c_1.\n\\tag4\n$$\n  The formula is an exact match if we let the intersection $c_2\\cdot c_1$ of two chains of dimensions $p_2$ and $p_1$ correspond to the product $\\omega_1\\omega_2$ of two forms of degrees $n-p_1$ and $n-p_2$. I followed the usual definitions, which is why one must reverse the order of factors. (...) To the index [sum of coefficients] of a $0$-chain there corresponds the number $I(\\omega)=\\smash{\\int_V\\omega}$ attached to any $n$-form, and one can show that all matching properties hold.\nBut I would now like to show that, much more than a mere formal duality, there is a deeper identity between $p$-chains and $(n-p)$-forms; or in other words, that on an $n$-dimensional manifold, a $p$-chain and an $(n-p)$-form are two instances of one and the same concept. This idea (...) is suggested by physical considerations, actually cases where physical quantities occur which can be represented, sometimes by a chain, sometimes by a form.\n\nAs @BS. said, de Rham goes on to unify both in the idea of a current $(c,\\omega)$ (pre-distribution theory).

I think the proof in Swan's book on K-theory makes the relation between the Freyd-Mitchell approach and Gabriel's approach pretty clear. Let me just say that there is no cheap way of getting the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem since there is a considerable amount of work you need to invest in order to get all the details straight. On the other hand, if you manage to feel comfortable with the details, you will have learned quite a good amount of standard tools of homological algebra, so I think it's well worth the effort.\nThink of the category of functors $\\scrA \\to \\Ab$ as $\\scrA$-modules, that's why the notation $\\amod$ is fairly common. The Yoneda embedding $A \\mapsto \\Hom(A,{-})$ even yields a fully faithful contravariant functor $y\\colon \\scrA\\to\\amod$.\nThe category $\\amod$ inherits a bunch of nice properties of the category $\\Ab$ of abelian groups:\n\nIt is abelian.\nIt is complete and cocomplete ((co-)limits can be computed pointwise on objects)\nThe functors $\\Hom(A,{-})$ are injective and $\\prod_{A \\in\\scrA} \\Hom{(A,{-})}$ is an injective cogenerator.\nSince there is an injective cogenerator, the category $\\amod$ is well-powered.\netc.\n\nHowever, the Yoneda embedding is not exact: If $0 \\to A' \\to A \\to A'' \\to 0$ is a short exact sequence, we only have an exact sequence\n$$0 \\to \\Hom(A',{-}) \\to \\Hom(A,{-}) \\to \\Hom(A'',{-})$$\nin $\\amod$.\nIt turns out that the functor $Q = \\coker{(\\Hom(A,{-}) \\to \\Hom(A'',{-}))}$ is \u201cweakly effaceable\u201d, so we would want it to be zero in order to get an exact functor. How can we achieve this? Well, just force them to be zero: say a morphism $f\\colon F \\to G$ in $\\amod$ is an isomorphism if both its kernel and its cokernel are weakly effaceable. If this works then a weakly effaceable functor $E$ is isomorphic to zero because $E \\to 0$ has $E$ as kernel. Now the full subcategory $\\scrE$ of weakly effaceable functors is a Serre subcategory, so we may form the Gabriel quotient $\\amod/\\scrE$. By its construction, isomorphisms in the Gabriel quotient have precisely the description above.\nOn the other hand, the category $\\Lex(\\scrA,\\Ab)$ of left exact functors $\\scrA \\to \\Ab$ is abelian. This is far from obvious when you start from the definitions. However, $\\Lex(\\scrA,\\Ab)$ sits comfortably inside the abelian category $\\amod$. The inclusion has an exact left adjoint (!) (= \u201csheafification\u201d), so again ${\\bf Lex}({\\scr A}, \\Ab)$ inherits many useful properties from $\\amod$. Moreover, the kernel of the left adjoint can be identified with the weakly effaceable functors, and that's why $\\Lex{(\\scrA, \\Ab)} = \\amod/\\scrE$.\nAll this work shows that $A \\mapsto \\Hom{(A,{-})}$ is a fully faithful and exact embedding of $\\scrA$ into ${\\Lex}{(\\scrA, \\Ab)}$, so it remains to show that the latter can be embedded into a category of modules. This is well described in Weibel's or Swan's books, so I won't elaborate on that point and content myself by saying that you simply need to look at the endomorphism ring of an injective cogenerator.\nAs for references, I think you can't do much better than Freyd's book. Don't be too intimidated by Swan's exposition in his K-theory book. If you're really interested in understanding this proof, I think it's worth reading the two expositions (first Freyd, then Swan).

They are contained in two joint papers, available at the publications page of Piranian's website (although the quality of the scans is not optimal),\n\n\"Sets of convergence of Taylor series.

The Cauchy convergence criterion says that $f(z)$ converges iff $$ \\forall n\\exists N\\forall m,k\\ge N |f_m(z)-f_k(z)|\\le 1/n. $$\nThis shows clearly that the set of $z$ on the unit circle where $f$ converges is a countable intersection (indexed by $n$) of a countable union (indexed by $N$) of closed sets (namely, the intersection over $m,k\\ge N$ of the sets $\\{z\\in C\\mid|f_m(z)-f_k(z)|\\le 1/n\\}$).\nThe conjecture is that any subset of $C$ that is a countable intersection of a countable union of closed sets is the set of convergence of some $f$. [Edit (Jan.12/12): This is not the case. See the update at the end.] These things are called $F_{\\sigma\\delta}$, though I've never quite liked the name.\nI have been interested in the problem (on and off) for a bit, so I have asked around what is known. Both Donald Sarason and Steve Krantz agreed that the state of the art seems to be whatever you find in the two papers listed above (Herzog and Piranian have a few papers on closely related topics, some may also be relevant). Alekos Kechris also pointed out that Ted Kaczynski, who was Piranian's student, had worked on related problems. There is a family of questions in the neighborhood of this one, that descriptive set theorists find interesting, so Alekos and other descriptive set theorists had followed some of this work for a little while. \nIn his thesis, Kaczynski proved that if we look at analytic functions $f$ the upper half plane, then the $F_{\\sigma\\delta}$ subsets of the real axis are precisely the sets $A$ for which there is such an $f$ so that $A$ is the set of points $p$ on the real axis such that there is an arc $\\gamma$ ending at $p$ such that the limit of $f(z)$ as $z$ approaches $p$ along $\\gamma$ exists. In his papers he finds several extensions of this result. It seems to me that his techniques are highly relevant to the problem you are asking.\nI emailed Piranian a few years ago, but sadly he never replied to my email, it would have been nice to meet him.\nThe results in the two papers above are as follows: In the first one, Herzog and Piranian trace the history of the problem (for example, Mazurkiewicz had shown that any closed subset of $C$ is the set of convergence of some $f$). They prove that every $F_\\sigma$ set is a set of convergence. Their technique is nice (it has a recursion theoretic flavor to it, at least for me, ensuring convergence in some regions and divergence in some others; it is akin to a priority argument), and it looks to me like the \"right\" kind of approach to this problem. A very simple version of their argument can be found in Rudin's analysis book, where it is shown that $$ \\sum_n \\frac{z^n}n $$ converges for all $z\\in C$ other than $z=1$. The general argument requires some easy trigonometric estimates (that they establish in sections 2,3).\nIn the second paper, they build some examples of $F_{\\sigma\\delta}$ sets that are not $F_\\sigma$ and yet are sets of convergence. These constructions are more ad hoc, at least to my untrained eyes, they are certainly much more involved than the results in the first paper. There are two proofs given there: The first elaborates the techniques of the paper by Erd\u00f6s-Herzog-Piranian mentioned by Gideon in a comment to the question, and so the functions that are obtained are injective in the unit disk. Granting injectivity is one of the main reasons for the difficulty of the approach. The second proof elaborates the approach of the first paper (so injectivity is not ensured here), and uses ideas of Fej\u00e9r (as mentioned by Theo in a comment below). The first argument allows one to deal with questions of uniform convergence; the second seems more general but does not grant this control. As the authors point out (and thanks to Theo for mentioning this in his comment) Fej\u00e9r's techniques suffice to show that there are non-$F_\\sigma$ sets of convergence. Unfortunately, I am not convinced these techniques alone suffice to establish the full characterization.\nHope this helps!

K\u00f6rner proves a result there that goes beyond what I discuss above and shows that the question of what sets are sets of convergence is not purely topological. \n\nTheorem (K\u00f6rner). There is a $G_\\delta$ subset of $C$ that is not a set of convergence.\n\n(This is theorem 6.2 in the paper.) The theorem builds on a result of Marcinkiewicz, who showed that if $a_n\\to0$ as $|n|\\to\\infty$, then $\\sum_{-N}^N a_n \\exp(int)$ cannot diverge boundedly everywhere as $N\\to\\infty$. This can be refined to show that, under the same assumptions, if $\\sum_{-N}^N a_n \\exp(int)$ is bounded for all $t$ in some interval $I$, then there is a subinterval $J\\subseteq I$ where $\\lim_{N\\to\\infty}\\sum_{-N}^N a_n \\exp(int)$ converges almost everywhere.\nThe construction makes use of (Cantor-like) sets of positive measure, and in particular leaves the following open: \n\nIs every $G_{\\delta\\sigma}$ set of Lebesgue measure zero the complement of a set of convergence? \n\n(Recall that Katznelson and Kahane have shown that every set of Lebesgue measure zero has a Fourier series diverging on it, and possibly elsewhere, see also this question.)\nI contacted K\u00f6rner, who indicated he didn't know of additional results.

Terry Tao mentions that from the perspective of probability, this reflects that the distribution of random variables $X$ and $Y$ is not enough to determine the distribution of $(X, Y)$ because $X$ and $Y$ are not necessarily independent.  \nGiven that the products in the usual category fail to exist, is it possible to define a new categorical structure on the class of measure spaces such that products do exist?", "output": "To clarify Chris Heunen's answer, let me point out that most notions of measure theory\nhave analogs in the category of smooth manifolds.\nFor example, the analog of a measure space (X,M,\u03bc), where X is a set, M is a \u03c3-algebra of measurable subsets of\u00a0X, and \u03bc is a measure on\u00a0(X,M),\nis a smooth manifold\u00a0X equipped with a density\u00a0\u03bc.\nLikewise, the analog of a measure-preserving morphism is a volume-preserving smooth map.\nThe category of smooth manifolds equipped with a density together\nwith volume preserving maps as morphisms does not have good categorical properties.\nThe problem comes from the fact that preservation of volume is too strong a condition to allow for good categorical properties.\nIf one drops the data of a density and the property of volume preservation,\nthen the resulting category of smooth manifolds has relatively good categorical properties,\nsuch as existence of finite products and, more generally, existence of all finite transversal limits.\nThe same is true for the category of measure spaces.\nHowever, in this case we cannot simply drop the data of a measure from the definition\nand expect to get a category with good properties.\nThe reason for this is that the data of a measure in fact combines two independent pieces of data.\nThe first piece of data tells us which sets have measure zero and which ones don't.\nThe second piece of data tells us the actual values of measure on sets of non-zero measure.\nThe analog of dropping the data of a density for measure theory is dropping the second piece\nof data described above, but not the first one.\nThis can already be seen for smooth manifolds: If we have a smooth manifold,\nwe don't need a density on it to say which sets have measure\u00a00.\nThus one is naturally led to the notion of a measurable space that knows which measurable\nsets have measure\u00a00.\nI describe it in more detail in\u00a0[1],\ntherefore here I offer only a brief summary of the main definitions.\nA measurable space is a triple\u00a0(X,M,N),\nwhere X is a set, M is a \u03c3-algebra of measurable subsets of\u00a0X, and N\u2282M is a \u03c3-ideal\nof measure\u00a00 sets.\nA morphism of measurable spaces f:\u00a0(X,M,N)\u2192(Y,P,Q) is an equivalence class of maps of sets g:\u00a0X\u2192Y\nsuch that the preimage of every element of\u00a0P is an element of\u00a0M and the preimage of every\nelement of\u00a0Q is an element of\u00a0N.  Two maps g\u00a0and\u00a0h are equivalent if they differ on a set of measure\u00a00.\nHere for the sake of simplicity I assume that both measurable spaces are complete\n(any subset of a measure\u00a00 subset is again a measure\u00a00 subset).\nEvery measurable space is equivalent to its completion\u00a0[2],\nhence we do not lose anything by restricting ourselves to complete measurable spaces.\nIn general, one has to modify the above definition to account for incompleteness, as explained\nin the link above.\nFinally, one has to require that measurable spaces are localizable.\nOne way to express this property is to say that the Boolean algebra M/N of equivalence\nclasses of measurable sets is complete (i.e., it has arbitrary suprema and infima).\nMany basic theorems of measure theory fail without this property.\nIn fact, as explained in the link above, theorems such as Radon-Nikodym theorem and Riesz\nrepresentation theorem are equivalent to the property of localizability.\nRemarkably, the category of localizable measurable spaces is equivalent to the opposite\ncategory of the category of commutative von Neumann algebras\u00a0[7].\nThis statement can be seen as another justification for the property of localizability.\nHenceforth I assume that all measurable spaces are localizable.\nBeing in possession of a good category of measurable spaces we can prove that it\nadmits finite products, and, more generally, arbitrary finite limits.\nLet me point out that at this point measure theory diverges from smooth manifolds:\nThe functor that sends a smooth manifold to its underlying measurable space\nis colax monoidal but not strong monoidal\nwith respect to the monoidal structures given by the categorical products.\nMore precisely, the category of measurable spaces admits two natural product-like monoidal\nstructures.  One is given by the categorical product mentioned above,\nand the other one is the spatial product, which is often simply called the product in many textbooks on measure theory.  By the universal property of product there is a canonical map from the spatial product\nto the categorical product, which is a monomorphism\nbut not an isomorphism unless one of the spaces is atomic, i.e., a disjoint union of points.\nThe forgetful functor\u00a0F from the category of smooth manifolds to the category of measurable\nspaces is strong monoidal with respect to the categorical product on the category\nof smooth manifolds and the spatial product on the category of measurable spaces.\nTherefore it is also colax monoidal with respect to the categorical product on measurable spaces,\nbut not strong monoidal because F is essentially surjective on objects and the map\nfrom the spatial product to the categorical product is not always an isomorphism.\nHere is an instructive example for the last statement.\nLet Z=F(R), where R is the real line considered as a smooth manifold.\nConsider the spatial product of Z and Z, which is canonically isomorphic to F(R\u00d7R).\nThe spatial product maps monomorphically to the categorical product\u00a0Y=Z\u00d7Z.\nHowever, Y is much bigger than F(R\u00d7R).\nFor example, the diagonal map Z\u2192Y=Z\u00d7Z is disjoint from F(R\u00d7R) in\u00a0Y.\nThe space\u00a0Y also has a lot of other subspaces\nwhose existence is guaranteed by the universal property.\nNote that set-theoretically F(R\u00d7R) also has a diagonal subset.\nHowever, this subset has measure\u00a00 and therefore is invisible in this formalism.\nLet me finish by mentioning that locales arguably provide much better formalism for measure theory,\nwhich in particular does not suffer from problems with sets of measure\u00a00,\ne.g., we don't need to pass to equivalence classes or even mention the words \u201calmost everywhere\u201d.\nThe relevant functor sends a measurable space (X,M,N) to the locale M/N (as explained\nabove M/N is a complete Boolean algebra, hence a locale).\nWe obtain a faithful functor from the category of measurable spaces to the category of locales.\nLet's call its image the category of measurable locales.\nThen measurable morphisms of measurable locales correspond bijectively \nto equivalence classes of measurable maps.\nNote that we don't need to pass to equivalence\nclasses to define a measurable morphism of measurable locales.\nEvery measurable space (or locale) can be uniquely decomposed into its atomic and diffuse part.\nThe atomic part is a disjoint union of points and the diffuse part does not have any isolated points.\nAn example of a diffuse space is given by F(M) where M is a smooth manifold of non-zero dimension.\n(In fact all these spaces are isomorphic as measurable spaces if the number of connected\ncomponents of\u00a0M is countable.)\nHere is the punchline: If Z is a diffuse measurable locale, then it does not have any points,\nin particular it is non-spatial.\nThis can serve as an explanation of why we cannot construct a reasonable concrete category\nof measurable spaces and why we always have to use equivalence classes if we want to stay\nin the point-set measure theory.\nReferences that advocate (but do not evangelize) the viewpoint described in this answer:\n\n[1] Is there an introduction to probability theory from a structuralist/categorical perspective?\n[2] What's the use of a complete measure?\n[3] Monoidal structures on von Neumann algebras\n[4] Why do probabilists take random variables to be Borel (and not Lebesgue) measurable?\n[5] Is there a measure zero set which isn't meagre?\n[6] When is $L^2(X)$ separable? \n[7] Reference for the Gelfand-Neumark theorem for commutative von Neumann algebras\n[8] Decomposition of an abelian von Neumann algebra\n[9] Subfactor theory and Hilbert von Neumann Algebras\n[10] Problems where we can't make a canonical choice, solved by looking at all choices at once\n[11] Integration of differential forms using measure theory?\n[12] Can we characterize the spatial tensor product of von Neumann algebras categorically?\n[13] Which complete Boolean algebras arise as the algebras of projections of commutative von Neumann algebras?\n[14] Conditional Expectation for $\\sigma$-finite measures", "meta": {"post_id": 49426, "input_score": 65, "output_score": 76, "post_title": "Is there a category structure one can place on measure spaces so that category-theoretic products exist?"}}

I ask with the dim hope that I may be wrong.\nMust the knot associated to 3 be the trefoil, as shown in LeBruyn's slides?", "output": "Jon,\nI should have been more careful in drawing the slide mentioned above (and reproduced below). I didn't want to convey the idea that there is a method to assign to a knot a specified knot (and certainly not one having exactly p crossings...).\nI only wanted to depict the result that different primes should correspond to different knots. \n (source)\nHere's the little I know about this :\nArtin-Verdier duality in etale cohomology suggests that $Spec(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a 3-dimensional manifold, as Barry Mazur pointed out in this paper\n (source)\nThe theory of discriminants shows that there are no non-trivial global etale extensions of $Spec(\\mathbb{Z})$, whence its (algebraic) fundamental group should be trivial. By Poincare-Perelman this then implies that one should view $Spec(\\mathbb{Z})$ as the three-sphere $S^3$. Note that there is no ambiguity in this direction. However, as there are other rings of integers in number fields having trivial fundamental group, the correspondence is not perfect.\nOkay, but then primes should correspond to certain submanifolds of $S^3$ and as the algebraic fundamental group of $Spec(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is the profinite completion of $\\mathbb{Z}$, the first option that comes to mind are circles\n (source)\nHence, primes might be viewed as circles embedded in $S^3$, that is, as knots! But which knots? Well, as far as I know, nobody has a procedure to assign a knot to a prime number, let alone one having p crossings. What is known, however, is that different primes must correspond to different knots\n (source)\nbecause the algebraic fundamental groups of $Spec(\\mathbb{Z})- \\{ p \\}$ differ for distinct primes. This was the statement I wanted to illustrate in the first slide.\nBut, the story goes a lot further. Knots may be linked and one can detect this by calculating the link-number, which is symmetric in the two knots. In number theory, the Legendre symbol, plays a similar role thanks to quadratic reciprocity\n (source)\nand hence we can view the Legendre symbol as indicating whether the knots corresponding to different primes are linked or not. Whereas it is natural in knot theory to investigate whether collections of 3, 4 or 27 knots are intricately linked (or not), few people would consider the problem whether one collection of 27 primes differs from another set of 27 primes worthy of investigation.\nThere's one noteworthy exception, the Redei symbol which we can now view as giving information about the link-behavior of the knots associated to three different primes. For example, one can hunt for prime-triples whose knots link as the Borromean rings\n (source)\n(note that the knots corresponding to the three primes are not the unknot but more complicated). Here's where the story gets interesting : in number-theory one would like to discover 'higher reciprocity laws' (for collections of n prime numbers) by imitating higher-link invariants in knot-theory.

You might initially think of this as a kind of quality-control problem in your invariant factory, to be eliminated by some more clever construction of an improved $\\Omega(t)$; but at the moment it seems that this is the wrong point of view:  there are interesting quantities that really do have wall-crossing behavior.\nTo name one example of such a quantity:  suppose you have a compact Kahler manifold $M$ with an anticanonical divisor $D$, and you want to construct the mirror of $M \\setminus D$ following the ideas of Strominger-Yau-Zaslow.  As it turns out, one of the essential ingredients you will need is a count of holomorphic discs in $M$, with boundary on a special Lagrangian torus $T(t)$ in $M$ (lying in a family parameterized by $t$).  The number of such discs in a given homology class exhibits wall-crossing as $t$ varies, and this wall-crossing turns out to be crucial in making the construction work.  This story has been developed by Auroux.\nIn physics, the wall-crossing phenomena that have been studied a lot recently arose in the context of \"BPS state counting\".  If you have a supersymmetric quantum field theory of the right sort, depending on parameters $t$, you can define a collection of numbers $\\Omega(\\gamma, t) \\in {\\mathbb Z}$:  they are superdimensions of certain graded Hilbert spaces attached to the theory (spaces of \"1-particle BPS states with charge $\\gamma$\").  These quantities exhibit wall-crossing as a function of $t$.\nMoreover, $\\Omega(\\gamma, t)$ are among the relatively few quantities in field theory that we are sometimes able to calculate exactly, so naturally they have attracted a lot of interest.  In particular, they are the subject of the Ooguri-Strominger-Vafa conjecture of 2004, which in some cases relates their asymptotics to Gromov-Witten invariants; the investigation of this conjecture (mostly by Denef-Moore) is what triggered the current resurgence of interest in wall-crossing from the physics side.\nA particular case is the $4$-dimensional quantum field theory (or supergravity) associated to a Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ (obtained by dimensional reduction of the $10$-dimensional string theory on the $6$-dimensional $X$ to leave $10-6=4$ dimensional space.)  In that case the physically-defined $\\Omega(\\gamma,t)$ are to be identified with the \"generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariants\" of $X$, studied by Joyce-Song and Kontsevich-Soibelman among others.  The mathematical interpretation of $t$ in that case is as a point on the space of Bridgeland stability conditions of $X$.  (If $X$ is compact, the last I heard, this space is not known to be nonempty, but the majority view seems to be that this gap will be filled...)  \nOne focal point for the excitement of the last few years is that a pretty remarkable wall-crossing formula has been discovered, the \"Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula\", which completely answers the question of how $\\Omega(t)$ depends on $t$, and seems to apply (in some form) to all of the situations I described above.

{"input": "There is often a lot of confusion surrounding the differences between relativizing individual formulas to models and the expression of \"is a model of\" through coding the satisfaction relation with G\u00f6del operations.  I think part of this can be attributed to the common preference for using formulas over codings.  For example, a standard proof showing that $V_{\\kappa} \\models ZFC$ for $\\kappa$ inaccessible will appeal to the fact that all of the ZFC axioms relativized to $V_{\\kappa}$ are true.  But then one learns about the L\u00e9vy Reflection Theorem scheme which allows every (finite) conjunction of formulas to be reflected to some $V_{\\alpha}$.  Perhaps this knowledge is followed by a question of whether the Compactness theorem can be used to contradict G\u00f6del's Second Incompleteness Theorem.\nSpecifically, consider the following erroneous proof that ZFC + CON(ZFC) proves its own consistency:  \nIntroduce a new constant $M$ into the language of set theory and add to the axioms of ZFC all of its axioms $\\varphi_n$ relativized to $M$, denoted $\\varphi_n^M$.  Provided that ZFC is consistent, every finite collection of this theory is consistent by the L\u00e9vy Reflection Theorem whereby the Compactness Theorem tells us that the entire theory ZFC + \"$M \\models ZFC$\" will be consistent.  Consequently, this theory has a (ZFC) model $N$ so in this model, there exists a model $M$ of ZFC.  To summarize then, arguing in ZFC + CON(ZFC), we've seemingly proven that we have a ZFC model $N$ modeling the consistency of ZFC by virtue of it having the model $M$ (i.e., seemingly $N \\models ZFC + CON(ZFC)$ so we would have a proof of CON(ZFC + CON(ZFC)).\nThe misstep in this proof is of course a misuse of the conclusion of the Compactness theorem, mainly the assumption that such an $N$ will think that $M$ is a ZFC model.  With some enumeration of the formulas of the axioms $\\{\\varphi_n| n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$ of ZFC, it is clear that $N$ will certainly think that $M \\models \\varphi_n$ for any particular $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ analogous to how a nonstandard model of Peano arithmetic has an element $c$ satisfying $c > n$ for any particular $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.  The problem of course in the case of $N$ is that there may be formulas with nonstandard indices not accounted for just as there will definitely be nonstandard numbers greater than $c$ in the PA example.\nIf one were to carry out the same proof with the more tedious arithmetization of syntax, then this link may be more apparent.\nTo a lesser extent, there may also be confusion with the fact that $0^{\\sharp}$ provides us with a proper class of $L(\\alpha) \\preceq L$.  This may lead to the question of whether $L$ has its own truth predicate, contradicting Tarski's Theorem.  But of course $L$ will only realize that each of these $\\varphi^{L(\\alpha)}$ is true for any ZFC axiom $\\varphi$, and if one attempts to appeal to the arithmetization of syntax, one can begin to see the problem that these $\\alpha$ may not (and of course will not) be definable (without parameters) in the constructible universe L.\nSince these types of misconceptions can be common among logicians and non-logicians alike, I thought I would ask the highly intelligent mathematicians who have worked through such problems or helped illuminate them to others if they would do so here as well.  I think compiling a collection of tidbits of wisdom in this area from the collective perspectives of the MO Community can be illuminating to all.  As such, my question is as follows:\n\nWhat insights can you share regarding the questions of formalizing \"is a model of ZFC\" in ZFC and the various \"paradoxes\" that arise?\n\nFor example, maybe you can show a related seemingly paradoxical problem and resolve it, or simply share your thoughts on how to avoid such traps of logic.", "output": "Here is a result along the lines you are requesting, which\nI find beautifully paradoxical.\nTheorem. Every model of ZFC has an element that is a\nmodel of ZFC. That is, every $M\\models ZFC$ has an element\n$m$, which $M$ thinks is a structure in the language of set\ntheory, a set $m$ and a binary relation $e$ on $m$, such\nthat if we consider externally the set of objects $\\bar\nm=\\{\\ a\\ |\\ M\\models a\\in m\\ \\}$ with the relation $a\\mathrel{\\bar e}\nb\\leftrightarrow M\\models a\\mathrel{e} b$, then $\\langle\n\\bar m,\\bar e\\rangle\\models ZFC$.\nMany logicians instinctively object to the theorem, on the\ngrounds of the Incompleteness theorem, since we know that\n$M$ might model $ZFC+\\neg\\text{Con}(ZFC)$. And it is true\nthat this kind of $M$ can have no model that $M$ thinks is\na ZFC model. The paradox is resolved, however, by the kind\nof issues mentioned in your question and the other answers,\nthat the theorem does not claim that $M$ agrees that $m$ is\na model of the ZFC of $M$, but only that it externally is a\nmodel of the (actual) ZFC. After all, when $M$ is\nnonstandard, it may be that $M$ does not agree that $m$\nsatisfies ZFC, even though $m$ actually is a model of ZFC,\nsince $M$ may have many non-standard axioms that it insists\nupon.\nProof of theorem. Suppose that $M$ is a model of ZFC. Thus,\nin particular, ZFC is consistent. If it happens that $M$ is\n$\\omega$-standard, meaning that it has only the standard\nnatural numbers, then $M$ has all the same proofs and\naxioms in ZFC that we do in the meta-theory, and so $M$\nagrees that ZFC is consistent. In this case, by the\nCompleteness theorem applied in $M$, it follows that there\nis a model $m$ which $M$ thinks satisfies ZFC, and so it\nreally does.\nThe remaining case occurs when $M$ is not\n$\\omega$-standard. In this case, let $M$ enumerate the\naxioms of what it thinks of as ZFC in the order of their Goedel numbers. An initial segment of\nthis ordering consists of the standard axioms of ZFC. Every\nfinite collection of those axioms is true in some\n$(V_\\alpha)^M$ by an instance of the Reflection theorem.\nThus, since $M$ cannot identify the standard cut of its\nnatural numbers, it follows (by overspill) that there is\nsome nonstandard initial segment of this enumeration that\n$M$ thinks is true in some $m=(V_\\alpha)^M$. Since this\ninitial segment includes all actual instances of the ZFC\naxioms, it follows that $m$ really is a model of ZFC, even\nif $M$ does not agree, since it may think that some\nnonstandard axioms might fail in $M$. $\\Box$\nI first learned of this theorem from Brice Halimi, who was visiting in New York in 2011, and who subsequently published his argument in:\n\n\nHalimi, Brice, Models as universes, Notre Dame J.

This is a very nice transitive set from $M$'s perspective. \nThere are other paradoxical situations that occur with countable computably saturated models of ZFC. First, every such M contains rank initial segment $(V_\\alpha)^M$, such that externally, $M$ is isomorphic to $(V_\\alpha)^M$. Second, every such $M$ contains an element $m$ which $M$ thinks is an $\\omega$-nonstandard model of a fragment of set theory, but externally, we can see that $M\\cong m$.

The pair of graphs\nwas constructed by a method, attributed to Schwenk, that I found in Doob's\nchapter of Topics in algebraic graph theory (edited by Beineke and Wilson).\nThe first 9 rows and columns of $A$, in common with $B$, come from a particular tree on 9 vertices that has a pair of attachment points such that extending the tree in the same way from either point gives isomorphic spectra.\nAdding a single pendant vertex cannot work for this problem, as I found using Brouwer and van Eijl's trick, mentioned\nby Chris Godsil, of comparing the Smith normal forms of (very) small polynomials in $A$ and $B$, in this case $A+2I$ and $B+2I$.  When a path of length two is added at either of the two special vertices, however, there doesn't seem to be any obstruction of this type.\nI then set about trying to conjugate both $A$ and $B$, separately, to the companion matrix of their mutual characteristic polynomial, by looking for a random small integer vector $x$ for which the matrix $X_A = [ x\\  Ax\\  A^2x\\  \\ldots\\  A^{10}x]$ has determinant $\\pm 1$, and similarly $y$ giving $Y_B$.  (The fact that I succeeded fairly easily may have something to do with the fact that $A+I$ is invertible over $\\mathbb Z$.)  The matrix\n$X_AY_B^{-1}$ then acts like the $C$ above.\n[EDIT: The actual matrix $C$ I found at random and first posted was not nearly so pretty, with a Frobenius norm nearly ten times the current example.  But taking powers 0 to 10 of $A$ times $C$ gave a $\\mathbb Q$-basis for the full space of conjugators, whose Smith normal form (as 11 vectors in $\\mathbb R^{121}$) was all 1's down the diagonal, so in fact it was a $\\mathbb Z$-basis.  Performing an LLL reduction on this lattice basis then gave a list of smaller-norm matrices, the third of which is the more illuminating $C$ given above, of determinant $-1$.  The other determinants from the reduced basis were all $0$ and $\\pm 8$.]\nTaking rational $x$ and not restricting the determinant of $X_A$ gives a space of possible rational matrices $C$ of dimension 11, which are generically invertible; varying $y$ gives the same space [EDIT: as does multiplying on the left by powers (or in the more general case commutants) of $A$].  Since the spectrum of $A$ has no repeated roots, this is also the dimension of the commutant of $A$, and every matrix conjugating $A$ to $B$ lies in this space.  Starting with a rational basis, it is not hard to find an exact basis for the integer sublattice, and taking the determinant of a general point in the integer lattice gives an integer polynomial in 11 variables which takes the value $1$ or $-1$ if and only if the matrices $A$ and $B$ are conjugate over $Z$.  If there are repeated roots, you have to work a little harder; in general the full space has dimension the sum of the squares of the multiplicities, and is generated by multiplying on the left by a basis for the commutator space of $A$.  A basis for the commutant can be produced (for a diagonalizable matrix) by first conjugating $A$ to a direct sum of companion matrices for the irreducible factors of the characteristic polynomial, and then one at a time, for each $k$-by-$k$ block corresponding to a $k$-times repeated factor of degree $m$, replacing each of the $k^2$ blocks with powers $0$ to $m-1$ of the companion matrix for that factor, with $0$ everywhere elsewhere.", "meta": {"post_id": 52169, "input_score": 30, "output_score": 41, "post_title": "Adjacency matrices of graphs"}}

The only fields that come to my mind that naturally exhibit all three of (a), (b), (c) (without also automatically exhibiting much richer algebraic structure, such as ring homomorphism structure) are complex dynamics, universal algebra, and certain types of cryptography, but I don't have enough experience in these fields to actually provide some interesting examples.", "meta": {"post_id": 53431, "input_score": 55, "output_score": 45, "post_title": "Does any research mathematics involve solving functional equations?"}}

My questions therefore are:\nWhat is the basic physical phenomenon/problem/question that vertex operators model?\nWhat is the subsequent story about vertex operators and conformal field theory, and how can we see that this leads naturally to the axioms of a vertex algebra?\nAre there accessible physical examples (\"consider two particles colliding in an infinite vacuum...\", etc.) that illustrate the key ideas?\nAlso, are there alternative, purely mathematical interpretations of vertex algebras which make them easier to think about intuitively?\nPerhaps people who played a role in their discovery could say a bit about the thinking process that led them to define these objects?", "output": "The original motivation for vertex algebras is explained briefly in the original paper http://www.jstor.org/stable/27441 as follows. For any even lattice one can construct a space $V$ acted on by vertex operators corresponding to lattice vectors. More generally one can write down a vertex operator for every element of $V$. These vertex operators satisfy some complicated relations, which are then used as the definition of a vertex algebra. In other words, the original example of a vertex algebra was the vertex algebra of an even lattice, and the definition of a vertex algebra was an axiomatization of this example. \nThis was motivated by my attempt to understand Igor Frenkel's work on the Lie algebra with Dynkin diagram the Leech lattice.  Frenkel had constructed a representation of this Lie algebra using vertex operators acting on the space $V$, and I was trying to use his work to understand its root multiplicities. I did not use any insights from conformal/quantum/topological field theory or operator product expansions when defining vertex algebras (as implied by some of the other answers), for the simple reason that I had barely heard of these concepts and had almost no idea what they were. \nThis is not all that helpful for understanding what a vertex algebra really is. A better view is to regard them as something like a commutative ring with an action of the (formal) 1-dimensional additive group. In particular any such ring is canonically a vertex algebra. The difference between rings with group actions and vertex algebras is that the \"multiplication\" of a vertex algebra from $V\\times V$ to $V$ is not defined everywhere: it can be thought of as a \"rational map\" rather than a \"regular map\" in some sense. More precisely if we write $u^g$ for the action of a group element $g$ on $u$, then the product $u^gv^h$ is not defined for all group elements $g$ and $h$, but behaves formally like a meromorphic function of $g$ and $h$, which in particular may have poles when $g$ and $h$ are trivial. Making sense of this informal idea produces the definition of a vertex algebra. (For more details see the unpublished paper http://math.berkeley.edu/~reb/papers/bonn/bonn.pdf.)

(I am really thinking of the category of pure motives, but there is no particular need to invoke that word.) \nIn each case we also have a natural abelian (in fact Tannakian) category in play: in the complex case, the category of pure Hodge structures, and in the other cases, the category of $\\ell$-adic representations of $G_K$ (the absolute Galois group of $K$) (for some prime $\\ell$, prime to the characteristic of $K$ in the case when $K$ is a finite field).  \nNow taking cohomology gives a functor from the category of smooth projective varieties to this latter category (via Hodge theory in the complex case, and the theory of etale cohomology in the other cases).  The Hodge conjecture (in the complex case) and the Tate conjecture (in the other cases) then says that this functor is fully faithful.\nThe consequence (if the conjecture is true) is that we can construct correspondences between varieties simply by making computations in some much more linear category.\nLet me give an example of how this can be applied in number theory:\nFix two primes $p$ and $q$, and let $\\mathcal O_D$ be a maximal order in the quaternion algebra $D$ over $\\mathbb Q$ ramified at $p$ and $q$, and split everywhere else (including at infinity).\nLet $\\mathcal O_D^1$ denote the multiplicative group of norm one elements in $\\mathcal O_D$.\nSince $D \\otimes_{\\mathbb Q} \\mathbb R \\cong M_2(\\mathbb R)$, we may regard $\\mathcal O_D^1$ as a discrete subgroup of $SL_2(\\mathbb R)$, and form the quotient $X := \\mathcal O_D^1\\backslash \\mathcal H$ (where $\\mathcal H$ is the upper half-plane).\nWe may also consider the usual congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(pq)$ consisting of matrices in $SL_2(\\mathbb Z)$ that are upper triangular modulo $pq$, and form $X_0(pq)$, the compacitifcation of $\\Gamma_0(pq)\\backslash \\mathcal H$.\nNow the theory of modular and automorphic forms and their associated Galois representations show that $X$ and $X_0(pq)$ are both naturally curves over $\\mathbb Q$, and that there\nis an embedding of Galois representations $H^1(X) \\to H^1(X_0(pq))$.  Thus the Tate conjecture predicts that there is a correspondence between $X$ and $X_0(pq)$ inducing \nthis embedding.  Passing to Hodge structure, we would then find that the periods of holomorphic one-forms on $X$ should be among the periods of holomorphic one-forms on $X_0(pq)$.\nNow the theory of $L$-functions shows that the periods of holomorphic one-forms on $X_0(pq)$ in certain cases compute special values of $L$-functions attached to modular forms on $\\Gamma_0(pq)$.  So putting this altogether, we would find that (given the Tate conjecture) we could compute special values of $L$-functions for certain modular forms by taking period integrals on the curve $X$.  In certain respects $X$ is better behaved than $X_0(pq)$, and so this is an important technique in investigating the arithmetic of $L$-functions.\nNow it happens that in this case the Tate conjectures is a theorem (of Faltings), and so\nthe above argument is actually correct and complete.\nBut there are infinitely many other analogous situations in the theory of Shimura varieties where the Tate conjecture is not yet known, but where one would like to know it. \nThere are also similar arguments where one uses the Hodge conjecture to move from information about periods to information about Galois representations and arithmetic.\nI should also say that there are lots of partial results along the above lines in these cases; there are many inventive techniques that people have introduced for getting around the Hodge and Tate conjectures.  (Deligne's use of absolute Hodge cycles, applications of theta corresondences by Shimura, Harris, Kudla, and others, ... .)  But the Hodge and Tate\nconjectures stand as fundamental guiding principles telling us what should be true, and which we would dearly like to see proved.\nSummary: algebraic cycles are very rich objects, which straddle two worlds, the world of period integrals and the world of Galois representations.  Thus, if the Hodge and Tate conjectures are true, we know that there are profound connections between those two worlds: we can pass information from one to the other through the medium of algebraic cycles.   If we had these conjectures available, it would be an incredible enrichment of our understanding of these worlds; as it is, people expend a lot of effort to find ways to pass between the two worlds in the way the Hodge and Tate conjectures predict should be possible.\nAnother example, added following the request of the OP to provide an example just involving complex geometry: If $X$ is a K3 surface, then from\nthe Hodge structure on the primitive part of $H^2(X,\\mathbb C)$, one can construct an\nabelian variety, the so-called Kuga--Satake abelian variety associated to $X$.  The\nconstruction is made in terms of Hodge structures.  One expects that in fact there should\nbe a link between $X$ and its associated Kuga--Satake abelian variety provided by some correspondence, but this is not known in general.   It would be implied by the Hodge conjecture.

But whereas complete intersections have an obvious geometric meaning, I don't know if this is true for CM schemes. Perhaps we can make somethinkg out of the following theorem: A noetherian ring $R$ is CM iff every ideal $I$ which can be generated by $ht(I)$ many elements is unmixed, i.e. has no embedded associated primes. Also, Eisenbud suggests that Cor. 18.17 in his book \"Commutative algebra with a view toward algebraic geometry\" reveals some kind of geometric meaning, but perhaps someone can explain this in detail?\nEvery integral curve is CM. Now assume that you are given a surface, given by some homogeneous equations, how do you \"see\" if it is CM or not?\n\nHailong's answer contains the link to How to think about CM rings?, which is pretty the same question as mine and has already some very good answers. So I appologize for this duplicate. But the answers here reveal some more insights, thanks!", "output": "[EDIT: I rewrote the first couple of paragraphs, because I realized a better way to say what I had in mind.]\nThere are many ways to define dimension and some of them give the same answer some of them don't. \nDepth is a sort of dimension. Perhaps not the most obvious, but one that works well in many situation. \nIn general we count dimension by chains and the main difference between Krull dimension and depth is about the same as the difference between Weil divisors and Cartier divisors. \nFor simplicity assume that we are talking about finite dimensional spaces. Infinite dimension can be dealt with by saying that it contains arbitrary dimensional finite dimensional spaces where we may substitute \"Krull dimension\" or \"depth\" in place of \"dimension\".\nI usually think of Krull dimension as going from small to large: We start with a (closed) point, embed it into a curve, then to a surface until we get to the maximal dimension. However, for comparing to depth it is probably better to think of it as going from large to small: Take a(n irreducible) Weil divisor, then a(n irreducible) Weil divisor in that and so on until you get to a point.\nIn contrast, when we deal with depth we take Cartier divisors: We start with the space itself (or an irreducible component), then take a(n irreducible) hypersurface, then the intersection of two hypersurfaces (such that it is a \"true\" hypersurface in each irreducible component this condition corresponds to the \"non-zero divisor\" provision)=a codimension $2$ complete intersection, and so on until we reach a zero dimensional set. \nSo, I would say that the geometric meaning of Cohen-Macaulay is that it is a space where our intuition about these two notions giving the same number is correct. I would also point out that this does not mean that necessarily all Weil divisors are Cartier, just that one cannot get a longer sequence of subsequent Weil divisors than Cartier divisors.\n\nAnother, less philosophical explanation is the following:\nCohen-Macaulay means that depth = dimension. $S_n$ means that this is true up to codimension $n$. Then one may try to give geometric meaning to the $S_n$ property and say that CM means that all of those properties hold.\nSo,\n$S_1$ --- means the existence of non-zero divisors, i.e., that there exists hypersurfaces that are like the ones we imagine.\n$S_2$ --- is perhaps the most interesting one, or the one that is the easiest to explain. See this answer to another question where it is explained how it corresponds to the Hartogs property, that is, to the condition that functions defined outside a codimension $2$ set can be extended to the entire space.\n$S_3$ --- I don't have a similarly nice description of this, but I am sure something could be made up, or some people might even know something nice. One thing is sure. This means that every (\"true\") hypersurface has the $S_2$ property, which has a geometric meaning as above.\n[...]\nSo, one could say that \n$S_n$ means that every (\"true\") hypersurface has the $S_{n-1}$ property, which we already described. \nI realize that this description of $S_n$ may not seem satisfactory, but in practice, this is very useful. I would also add that in moduli theory it is actually important to know that some properties are inherited by hypersurfaces (=fibers of morphisms), so saying that hypersurfaces are $S_2$ is actually a good property. \nMore specifically, for example, the total space of a family of stable (resp. normal, $S_2$) varieties is $S_3$ (\"is\" as in \"has to be\"). Then one might (as in Shafarevich's conjecture, see Parshin's Theorem, Arakelov's Theorem, Manin's Theorem, Faltings' Theorem) study deformations of these families (say the embedded deformations of a curve in the moduli stack of the corresponding moduli problem). Then the total space of these deformations ought to be $S_4$ on account of their fibers having to be $S_3$ since their fibers have to be $S_2$. This actually explains why it is not entirely bogus to say that $S_4$ means that codimension $2$ complete intersections satisfy the Hartogs property.\nThis actually reminds me another thing that is important about CM. A lot of properties are inherited by general hypersurfaces. The CM property is inherited by all of them. This makes them perfect for inductive proofs.\n\nOne way to see that a surface is CM is that normal $\\Rightarrow$ CM. Of course, the point is that normal is equivalent to $R_1$ and $S_2$, so it always implies $S_2$ and if the dimension is at most $2$, then $S_2$ is the same as CM. If you have a non-normal surface, but it is non-normal only because it has normal crossings in codimension one, then it is CM. You may also try to test directly for the Hartogs property mentioned above:\nA reduced surface $S$ is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if for any $P\\in S$ and any regular function $f$ defined on $U\\setminus \\{P\\}$ for an open set $P\\in U\\subseteq S$ there exists a regular function $g$ on $U$ such that $g_{|U\\setminus \\{P\\}}=f$.", "meta": {"post_id": 54876, "input_score": 56, "output_score": 55, "post_title": "Geometric meaning of Cohen-Macaulay schemes"}}

As of this writing, there is a short proof here (Internet Archive).)\nThe point is that it is consistent that every set of reals is measurable, and therefore every function $f:{\\mathbb R}\\to{\\mathbb R}$ is measurable.\nThe first to realize that it is possible using choice to construct a non-linear additive function was Hamel in 1905 (Hamel, G., Eine Basis aller Zahlen und die unstetigen L\u00f6sungen der Funktionalgleichung: (f(x+y) =f(x) +f(y))., Math. Ann. 60, 459-462 (1905). ZBL36.0446.04.); indeed, a Hamel basis of ${\\mathbb R}$ over ${\\mathbb Q}$ allows us to provide examples. Note that with a Hamel basis it is straightforward to build Vitali's standard example of a non-measurable set.\nSolovay (Solovay, R. M., A model of set-theory in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, Ann. Math. (2) 92, 1-56 (1970). ZBL0207.00905.) proved that, relative to the consistency of an inaccessible cardinal, via forcing we can prove that it is consistent with ZF + DC that all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable (DC is the axiom of dependent choice, a weak version of the axiom of choice useful to develop the basic theory of analysis). It follows that, in Solovay's model, all additive functions are linear and therefore no \"explicit\" example is possible.\nThe other standard approach to models where all sets of reals are measurable is via determinacy. However, this requires a stronger commitment in terms of consistency strength (using $\\omega$ Woodin cardinals we can force an inner model of determinacy). The two approaches are closely related: Assuming enough large cardinals, the inner model $L({\\mathbb R})$ consisting of all sets constructible from reals is a model of determinacy, and a Solovay model. Note that this is a theorem (from enough large cardinals) rather than a consistency result, i.e., $L({\\mathbb R})$ is a model of these statements, without needing to pass to a forcing extension.\nSolovay's result does require an inaccessible cardinal, this is a result of Shelah (Shelah, Saharon, Can you take Solovay\u2019s inaccessible away?, Isr. J. Math. 48, 1-47 (1984). ZBL0596.03055.). This leaves the question of whether (the consistency of) ZF suffices to produce a model where all additive maps are linear. But this is now easily solved: In the same paper, Shelah proved that it is relatively consistent with ZF that all sets of reals have the property of Baire. The standard proofs that additivity and measurability give linearity work with \"Baire measurability\" instead of Lebesgue measurability.\nLet me close, however, by pointing out that, in appropriate models of set theory, we can \"explicitly\" build additive, non-linear maps. More precisely, in nice inner models, we have explicitly definable well-orderings of the reals, from which such maps can be built. For example, in G\u00f6del's inner model L of constructible sets, there is an easily definable Hamel basis (see this MO question), from which we can easily define such a function. \"Easily\" is formalized in terms of the projective hierarchy. The Hamel basis we obtain is $\\Pi^1_1$ and the function is $\\Sigma^1_2$.\n(By the way, the statement \"there is a discontinuous additive function\" is form 366 in Howard-Rubin \"Consequences of the axiom of choice\".

The Lorentzian metric on the manifold has signature (-+...+), and thus distinguish between time-like, space-like, and null directions. A $C^1$ curve in your manifold is said to be time-like if its tangent vector is always time-like (similarly space-like/null). \nFor physical reasons we expect our manifold to be time-orientable: the set of time-like vectors in the tangent space has two connected components. We assume there is a continuous (non-vanishing) time-like vector field, which denotes the direction of \"future\". \nA point $p$ is said to be in the chronological future of another point $q$ if there is a time-like, futurely directed curve originating from $q$ to $p$. \nAsymptotic regions\nFor (possibly outdated by modern cosmological observation) physical reasons, one may assume that the local geometry of space-time far away from (large) gravitating bodies is nearly flat. Let $M$ be a Lorentzian manifold which for now we assume to be diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}\\times \\Sigma$, with the restriction of the metric on the $\\Sigma$ leaves Riemannian. An asymptotic end of $\\Sigma$ is a connected component of $\\Sigma \\setminus K$ for some compact set $K$ that is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^d\\setminus B_1$. This induces a nice coordinate system on $M\\setminus (\\mathbb{R}\\times K)$ (which allows us to talk about the radius function $r$). We make the flatness assumption (which can be justified by possibly enlarging $K$) that in each asymptotic region, future (or null) directed null rays $\\gamma$ that remain in the asymptotic region for all parameter $s\\in [s_0,\\infty)$ will have $\\lim_{s\\to\\infty} r(\\gamma) = \\infty$. \nFix now one asymptotic region, call it $M_\\infty$. Its corresponding domain of outer communications $D_\\infty$ consists of all points of $M$ which can be reached from $M_\\infty$ by both a future time-like curve and a past time-like curve. \nIntuitively speaking, each domain of outer communications is a connected region which can \"communicate\" with the asymptotic region through exchange of light-signals. In particular, it lies outside any black holes or white holes. \nWorm holes\nA simple description of a worm-hole space-time is just a connected Lorentzian manifold with multiple domains of outer communication. \nFor them to be of physical interest, we require there to exist a time-like or null curve originating from one domain of outer communication and ending in another. This represents the ability to send signals or even travelers between two \"almost disjoint\" regions of the universe. \n\nSo far it should be clear that you need some knowledge of differential/pseudo-Riemannian geometry at the very least to study worm holes. \n\nThe mathematical study of wormholes essentially boils down to writing down \n\nSufficient conditions to rule out their existence\nExplicit examples of wormhole solutions\n\nLet me start with the latter to motivate the former. The most classical solution to Einstein's equation in general relativity that admits a wormhole is the Reissner-Nordstrom charged black hole solution. This solution models a charged black hole, and the explicit analytic extension of the solution to the interior of the black hole reveal some possible structure. In particular, observers who fall into the black hole may not necessarily encounter a singularity in finite time (as opposed to the situation in Schwarzschild black holes). And based on the analytic extension, it is possible that such an observer will emerge after some time into another domain of outer communications by being spat out of a white whole. \nTwo key things to notice:\n\nThis worm hole is \"one-way only\"\nI kept using the phrase analytic extension\n\nAs it turns out, under fairly generic conditions on the properties of the universe and the matters residing within it (in particular the dominant energy condition which also played a strong role in the Positive Mass Theorem of Schoen and Yau), worm holes can \"only be one way\". (Actually, with certain additional assumptions worm holes cannot even exist.) Results of this type are captured (as easy corollaries) under the name \"Topological Censorship\". The original version of the result states that the domain of outer communication must be (under certain reasonable physical assumptions) homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R} \\times (\\mathbb{R}^d\\setminus B_1)$. A recent improvement by Galloway and collaborators states that (under reasonable physical assumptions including global hyperbolicity [more on which later]) any future directed time-like or null curve that starts from one asymptotic region and ends in another (a priori possibly different) asymptotic region must be entirely contained in one domain of outer communication. (Which basically states that wormholes don't exist unless you violate one of the physical assumptions; and if you remove global hyperbolicity, you can possibly obtain one-way worm holes.)\n(There is also a much more classical result in the reverse direction: if a space-time admits a Cauchy hypersurface [a special type of a spatial slice] that has non-trivial topology, it must be geodesically incomplete [which suggests that there should be a black hole].)\nThe second issue at play is this analytic extension business. If you know a bit about the wave equation, please recall that it has the finite speed of propagation property. That is, when solving the initial value problem, the value of the solution at any given point in space-time depends can only on a compact sub-set of the initial space-like slice. (Or, in physical description, information does not travel faster than the speed of light.) Applying this to Einstein's equation of general relativity, one obtains the notion of \"Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Extension\" corresponding to a set of given initial data: the largest set in the space-time which is completely determined by the given initial data. \nA priori, it is not clear whether the maximal globally hyperbolic extension can be further extended as a solution to the Einstein's equations. (Of course, such an extension will be non-unique, but it is interesting to ask whether they exist at all.) And in fact, in certain situations, more extension can be constructed by (real) analytic continuation of the solution. The case of Reissner-Nordstrom is one particular one, and it is due to this possible extension that we have the wormhole behaviour. \nAn open problem in mathematical general relativity is whether one can rule-out such extensions \"generically\". The \"strong cosmic censorship conjecture\" posits that the answer is positive: that the existence of such extensions requires the space-time to be conspiratorially nice.  \nGoing back to the issue of constructing solutions/examples: as any example, to be physically meaningful, will be required to solve Einstein's equation, topological methods tend to be less useful in this context (unless you mean Gromov's h-principle), as geometry and analysis tend to be more \"rigid\" structures. \n\nIn classical mathematical GR, as you can see, topology has not come into play strongly. (The \"problems\" introduced by topology tend to be considered as pathological; lots of work were done in the 60s and 70s to discuss sufficient conditions to rule out such pathologies.) Differential/pseudo-Riemannian geometry and mathematical analysis (esp of PDEs) are generally used more heavily. \nBut that is not to say that topology has no role. It is more that the role of topology is much less clear, beyond the more simple applications of point-set topology, and some slightly less trivial applications based on connections between Riemannian geometry and topology. \nIn conclusion, let me give you some possible references if your student can be satisfied by black holes instead of wormholes.

Therefore, it suffices to determine which values of $\\delta$ yield a pair of elements in either a conjugate of $O(2)$, or a conjugate of one of the three Platonic groups (isomorphic to $A_4$, $S_4$, and $A_5$).\nIn order for $AB$ and $AB^{-1}$ to both lie in a conjugate of $O(2)$ it is necessary and sufficient that they have a common eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\pm 1$ - this eigenvector is the axis of rotation.  Writing this requirement explicitly yields a polynomial identity in $\\sin \\delta$ and $\\cos \\delta$ (whose solutions I haven't enumerated yet). Edit: Some straightforward case elimination with the $z$ coordinate of a common eigenvector shows that $\\delta$ must be an integer multiple of $\\pi/2$.\nFor the Platonic solutions, we can narrow down the solution set using the criterion that the rotation $(AB^{-1})^{-1}(AB) = B^2$ lies in the group, and Platonic solids have rotational symmetries of order at most 5.  This means $\\delta$ is a multiple of $\\pi/3$, $\\pi/4$ or $\\pi/5$.\nSince the traces of $AB$ and $AB^{-1}$ are both $(\\cos \\delta)(2 + \\cos \\delta)$, we can compare with character table entries to see if that number is the trace of an element in a Platonic group.

{"input": "Not to sound like a refusenik or a contrarian, but I have always been a bit of an agnostic when it comes to the arXiv. Somewhere deep in my old Pine folders there is a 15 y.o. discussion with Greg Kuperberg on the subject, and it seems the history proved him right - the arXiv is now incredibly valuable and popular (perhaps, even a little too popular, see below).  However, despite all the benefits, I think posting on the arXiv is a serious decision, often enough a good idea, but not always, and definitely not without downside as Matthew Daws writes (to a wide 27+ support):\n But, definitely use the arxiv! I don't see any downside to putting a preprint on the arxiv; and it might lead to more people reading your work and hence more recognition.\nWhile benefits of the arXiv are well known and understood, as evidenced by the growth in the volume of submissions, I believe negative aspects are somewhat less known.  Thus, my question: \nDo you know any downsides of using the arXiv? \nIf yes, tell us what are they.  Is there a story behind?  If no, say nothing, of course. I start with a few (mostly minor) quips below to get this started (see also here for a rare critical blog post in another field).  \n\n1)  If you are a graduate student or a junior faculty, you might not be as fast as others in developing your own ideas.  As soon as you post early results which use your new ideas, they become a fair game. Now someone else can recognize their value and quickly solve your main problem before you are half way through.  On the other hand, going the more traditional print publication route would give a couple of years cushion, sufficient in most cases.  \n2)  On a related subject of destructive competition, arXiv can be really unhelpful.  One graduate student I know liked a conjecture posed in an arXiv preprint.  He solved it in about two months.  When he was finishing writing his solution, somebody posted an identical solution.  He was quite distressed.  Another graduate student I know, discovered two weeks before the Ph.D. defense that the main result in her thesis was just posted on the arXiv in a more general form by a senior faculty elsewhere.  Upon insistence of her advisor, she cancelled the defense and left academia without a Ph.D. degree.  \n3)  An obvious point:  some/many arXiv preprints are incorrect, leading to questions like this one.  This creates a bizarre \"neither solved nor open\" status: while a solution of an important problem is being checked, no one wants to work on the problem.  On rare occasions, two opposite solutions are posted leading to partial paralysis in the field.  BTW, plagiarism is yet another variation on this issue (here the authorship is incorrect).  \n4)  The other side of the same coin: if a person (like one friend of mine) posts an incorrect solution of a famous problem, this creates too much attention, potentially destroying a career (esp if in the early stages).  \n5)  The \"unaffiliated people problem\" which makes it hard from people from third world countries, as well as anonymous authors to contribute (not everyone is as brave as Mn\u0451v, see my answer here).  While arXiv's restrictions do help get rid of some cranks, there are other ways to do that, and one can argue that one gem from an unaffiliated author is worth 100 crank papers.  \n6)  Some people apparently read arXiv every day.  Really?  One friend of mine (in physics) admitted to me he spends 1.5-2 hours every morning doing that.  Really???\n7)  ArXiv's success also has downsides, as it increases pressure on young mathematicians to post, so as to keep up with others, even if their natural instinct in some cases maybe is to be protective of their ideas and further develop them before making them public.  The social pressure can be quite strong, as hiring committees increasingly view arXiv preprints as \"near publications\".  More anecdotally, one senior mathematician I know likes to ask people \"What's your most recent arXiv paper?\" in place of a more traditional \"What are you working on?\" as if arXiv posting is a \"must do\" for everyone. \n8)  An indirect and less obvious downside:  arXiv's success clearly slowed down rather than sped up the natural tendency to bypass traditional print publishers for electronic media, as there is less of a pressure to have all journals nearly free and widely accessible. This is contrary to the early predictions which expected for the transition to happen before 2010.", "output": "There is no downside to arXiv.  If you don't want to post a paper there, then don't.  If you don't want to read papers on arXiv or to study the daily collection of abstracts of papers just posted, then don't.  Nor is there any issue of plagiarism of ideas from arXiv that is different from plagiarism from a journal article.  To publish an article means to make it public.  A manuscript uploaded to arXiv is a publicly accessible and, therefore, a published manuscript, with the author's name attached to all the ideas, theorems, proofs, and conjectures that the paper contains.  \nThere is also an important democratizing aspect of arXiv.  In many fields of mathematics, preprints used to be circulated privately among a small group of insiders and their students.  It was difficult for outsiders to learn about new results and problems, and to \"break into\" the club.  It was essentially impossible for mathematicians in many poor countries to have access to research papers; the mathematicians were isolated and their universities could not afford journal subscriptions.  Now all they need is internet access to find out about current research.  The establishment of arXiv as a central repository for preprints in all fields of mathematics is an extraordinarily significant accomplishment, and will have a profound impact on the future of mathematics.", "meta": {"post_id": 65090, "input_score": 29, "output_score": 51, "post_title": "Downsides of using the arXiv?

Johan Commelin, Patrick Massot and I are in the process of writing up a more formal document explaining what we had to do to construct this type.\nThis definition of a perfectoid space is completely mathematically unambiguous. All terms are defined precisely, and if you don't know what something means then you can right click on it and look at its definition directly, if you compile the software using the Lean theorem prover. Lean is a computer program which checks that definitions and theorems are formally complete and correct. The definitions and theorems have to be written in Lean's language of course. The definition above says that a perfectoid space is a topological space equipped with the appropriate extra structure (sheaf of complete rings, valuation on stalks etc) and which is covered by spectra of perfectoid rings, and a perfectoid ring is a complete uniform Tate ring  with the usual perfectoid property. The main work is developing enough of the theory of completions of topological rings and valuations to put the appropriate structure on the adic spectrum of a Huber pair; in total this was over 10,000 lines of code.\nComputer scientists have been developing and using formal proof verification tools for decades. I want to make the slightly contentious statement that 99.9% of the time they are working on statements about the kind of mathematical objects which we teach to undergraduates (groups, graphs, 2-spheres etc). There have been some huge successes in this area (computer-checked proofs of Kepler conjecture, odd order theorem, four colour theorem etc). My impression is that on the whole mathematicians are either unaware of, or not remotely interested in, this work, which for the most part concentrates on proving tricky theorems about \"low-level\" objects such as finite groups. I have now seen what these systems are capable of and in particular I believe that if mathematicians, rather than computer scientists, start working with formal theorem provers then we can build a database of definitions and statements of theorems which would be far far more interesting to the mathematical community than what the computer scientists have managed to do so far. Tom Hales is leading the Formal Abstracts project which aims to do precisely this. Furthermore, I now believe that theorem provers will inevitably play some role in the future of mathematical research. I am not entirely clear about what this role is yet, but one thing I am 100 percent convinced of is that AI will not be proving hard theorems that humans can't do, any time soon. However I am equally convinced that computers will soon be helping us to do research -- perhaps by giving us powerful targeted search through databases of theorems which humans have claimed to prove, and perhaps in the future pointing out gaps in the mathematical literature, as human mathematicians begin to formalise computer proofs more and more.", "meta": {"post_id": 65729, "input_score": 143, "output_score": 69, "post_title": "What are \"perfectoid spaces\"?"}}

Often $f$ is a rational function, which automatically satisfies the condition as long as it is not a polynomial.  The technique is simply:\n\nUse the power-series expansion to write $f(x) = P(x) + O(1/x)$ with $P \\in {\\bf Q}[x]$, find a common denominator $D$ so that $DP \\in {\\bf Z}[x]$, and observe that once $x$ is large enough that the $O(1/x)$ error drops below $1/D$ in absolute value the only way that $Df(x)$ can be integral is for $x$ to be a root of $f(x) = P(x)$.  This reduces the problem to a finite search.\n\nThe OP didn't say where exactly his question came from, but such problems arise often in the theory of combinatorial designs and strongly regular graphs.  For example, in a Moore graph of girth 5 and degree $d$, every vertex has $d$ neighbors and any two distinct vertices are xeither adjacent xor have a common neighbor, in which case that neighbor is unique.  Using the fact that every eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix has integral multiplicity, one shows that either $d=2$ or $d=m^2+m+1$ for some integer $m$ such that $(m^2+m+1)(m^2+m-1) / (2m+1) \\in {\\bf Z}$.  So we write\n$$\n16 \\frac{(m^2+m+1) (m^2+m-1)} {2m+1} = 8m^3+12m^2+2m-1 - \\frac{15}{2m+1}\n$$\nand (since $15/(2m+1)$ cannot vanish) deduce that $2m+1 \\leq 15$, so $m \\leq 7$.  We then find that of the remaining candidates only $m=1,2,7$ work.  Hence $d$ is one of 2, 3, 7, or 57.  [See for instance Cameron and Van Lint's Designs, Graphs, Codes and their Links (LMS 1991, 1996) for this and many more examples.  As it happens, each of $d=2,3,7$ occurs for a unique Moore graph, namely the 5-cycle, Petersen graph, and Hoffman-Singleton graph respectively, while the existence of a Moore graph of degree 57 is a famous open problem.]\nFurther shortcuts may be available when $D$ and/or the implicit constant in $O(1/x)$ are large enough that the concluding search, though finite, is still inconvenient or infeasible to do exhaustively.  For example, in the Moore graph problem, $15/(2m+1)$ must be integral, so $2m+1$ must be a factor of $15$, and this immediately yields the solutions $m=1,2,7$, corresponding to factors $3,5,15$.  The numerator $15$ could have been predicted by from the value $15/16$ taken by $(m^2+m+1) (m^2+m-1)$ at $m=-1/2$, the root of the denominator $2m+1$.  More generally if $f(x)$ is a rational function $A(x)/B(x)$ with $A,B \\in {\\bf Z}[x]$ relatively prime, we can use the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials to find $M,N \\in {\\bf Z}[x]$ such that\n$MA-NB$ is a nonzero integer, say $R$; then if $f(x)$ is an integer then so is\n$$\n M(x) f(x) - N(x) = \\frac{M(x)A(x) - N(x)B(x)}{B(x)} = \\frac{R}{B(x)} ,\n$$\nand we need only find integer solutions of $B(x) = r$ for each of the factors $r$ of $R$ and test each of these candidates.  $R$ is a factor of the resultant of $A$ and $B$.  This is actually not far from G.Robinson's analysis: if we square to get the rational function $m^2 (7m^2-22m+7)^2 / ((m^2-2m+9)(9m^2-2m+1))^2$, the resultant is $2^{36} 3^{12}$, explaining the factors of 2 and 3 that arose in that solution.  There are still $2 \\cdot 37 \\cdot 13 = 962$ factors to try (allowing negative as well as positive $r$), but that's much less than the number of candidates that the generic method would require testing.", "meta": {"post_id": 66873, "input_score": 16, "output_score": 42, "post_title": "How to decide this function takes integer values?"}}

Thus $\\dim R=3$ at least, and we may assume $R=k[[x,y,z]]$ (let's suppose everything are complete and contains a fied).  \nSince $I$ is not a complete intersection, it must have more than $3$ minimal generators. If it has $4$ then it would be an almost complete intersection, and by an amazing result by Kunz (see this answer), those are never Gorenstein.\nSo, in summary, a simplest $0$-dimensional Gorenstein but not complete intersection would have to be $k[[x,y,z]]/I$, where $I$ is generated by at least $5$ generators.

{"input": "I am doing my PhD in algebraic graph theory, for not much more reason than that was what was available.  However, I love deep structure and theory in mathematics, and I do not particularly want to be a graph theorist for the rest of my life.  \nI have heard of mathematicians changing from more theoretical subjects to broad ones like combinatorics, but not the other way round, and am concerned that this is because the time it takes to learn the requisite theory for deeper subjects is hard to come by after grad school.\nHas anyone done this, or known of someone who has?  Is it at all likely or possible I will be able to get a post-doc position in a subject only marginally connected to my thesis?  I have been using small amounts of algebraic number theory, and would ideally like to go on and specialise in something similar.\nAny advice much appreciated!  \nEDIT (June '12) - I came across this old question of mine, and now feel rather silly for having asked it at all.  For the record, and for anyone who might be having similar doubts to me: a year or so on I have realised that, as was mentioned below, I should not pigeonhole myself, and that the most interesting problems are often those that lead to other seemingly disparate subfields.  Perhaps more to the point, I actually can't now think of a subject I'd rather do than algebraic graph theory!  If you find yourself in the position I was in, I advise you to just look for those problems you find most interesting in your \"chosen\" field - they are bound to lead to other areas.  And anyway, surely all that matters is that you are interested and inspired?!  In my own research I have used number theory, galois theory, group theory, and even a bit of probability.  I might even opine that graph theory is one of the subjects most likely to appear in intra-disciplinary work, which seems to be forming an ever higher proportion of mathematical research.", "output": "Speaking as someone whose thesis was also in algebraic graph theory but who has later gone on to do research in other areas, I would say that it is definitely possible to switch fields.  The main skills you need are management skills: the ability to manage your own time so that you can spend some time learning a new field while also producing something that others will value, and the ability to manage other people's view of your work.  In this regard, I believe that Deane Yang's comment is right on the money.  You probably can't afford to drop your initial specialty abruptly and produce no results while you retrain yourself.  But if you manage things carefully then anything is possible, regardless of whether you have tenure or are switching to a field that requires a lot of background study.\nThere are some things you can do to help you solve these management problems.  If you can find overlap between your current field and your new field, that will obviously help.  Mathematics is so interconnected that this is usually not too hard; in the specific case of algebraic graph theory versus algebraic number theory, the first topic to come to mind is the Ihara zeta function of a graph, but I'm sure there are others.\nIn my case, I decided it would help to switch from academics to industry/government.  I personally found it easier in industry/government to spend x% of my time producing results that pleased my employers and spending the remaining (100-x)% of my time training myself in a new area.  Your mileage may vary, of course; in my case, I found that teaching drained me of too much of my energy, but this is not true of everybody.\nOne last comment I have is that if you take this route, then you will need the ability to maintain a clear sense of your own identity and goals and not be unduly swayed by other people's categorizations.  For example, when I switched out of academics, many others regarded me as \"leaving mathematics.\"  In fact I was only leaving academics and not leaving mathematics, and it was important for me to ignore other people's view of the matter.  As another example, people will want to pigeonhole you as a \"something-ist\" (and it seems you have been influenced by this point of view, since you use the phrase \"being a graph theorist for the rest of my life\"); you should resist this pigeonholing, and instead think of yourself just as someone with certain abilities and interests.  Thinking of yourself as either a graph theorist or a number theorist is unnecessarily limiting.  (Of course you may need to bill yourself as one or the other for the purposes of managing other people's view of you while you're making a transition, but you should not necessarily believe your own propaganda.)", "meta": {"post_id": 69937, "input_score": 51, "output_score": 42, "post_title": "Changing field of study post-PhD"}}
{"input": "Consider the initial value problem\n$$ \\partial_t u = \\partial_{xx} u$$\n$$ u(0,x) = u_0(x)$$\nfor the heat equation in one dimension, where $u_0: {\\bf R} \\to {\\bf R}$ is a smooth initial datum and $u: [0,+\\infty) \\times {\\bf R} \\to {\\bf R}$ is the smooth solution.  Under reasonable growth conditions on $u_0$ and $u$ (e.g. $u_0$ and $u$ are at most polynomial growth), there is a unique solution $u$ to this problem given by the classical formula\n$$ u(t,x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi t}} \\int_{\\bf R} e^{-|x-y|^2/4t} u_0(y)\\ dy.$$\nHowever, as is well known, once one allows $u_0$ or $u$ to grow sufficiently rapidly at infinity, then smooth solutions to the heat equation are no longer unique, as demonstrated first by Tychonoff in 1935.\nMy question then concerns the corresponding question for existence : does there exist smooth initial data $u_0$ for which there are no global smooth solutions $u$ to the initial value problem for the heat equation?\nOne obvious candidate for such \"bad\" data would be a backwards heat kernel, such as\n$$ u_0(x) = e^{|x|^2/4}.$$\nOne can verify that\n$$ u(t,x) = \\frac{1}{(1-t)^{1/2}} e^{|x|^2/4(1-t)}$$\nis a smooth solution to the initial value problem for the heat equation with initial datum $u_0$ up to time $t=1$, at which point it blows up (rather dramatically).  However, this does not fully solve the problem due to the aforementioned lack of uniqueness; just because this particular solution $u$ blows up, there could be some other more exotic smooth solution with the same data which somehow manages to retain its smoothness beyond the time $t=1$.  This seems highly unlikely to me, but I was not able to demonstrate such an \"unconditional non-existence\" result - the absence of any growth hypotheses at infinity seems to destroy most methods of controlling solutions, and could potentially create some strange scenario in which one could continually keep singularities from forming by pumping in infinite quantities of energy from spatial infinity in just the right manner.  But perhaps there is some literature on this problem?", "output": "It is true that for any initial datum $u_0\\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$ there exists a solution $u\\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^+\\times\\mathbb{R})$ to the heat equation with initial condition $u(0,x)=u_0(x)$. As you point out, this will not be unique.\nI can give a method of constructing such solutions now. The idea is to show that we can write $u=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_n$ where $f_n$ are carefully constructed solutions chosen such that the partial sums $\\sum_{n=0}^mf_n(0,x)$ eventually agree with $u_0(x)$ any bounded subset of the reals, and for which $f_n$ tends to zero arbitrarily quickly in the compact-open topology. First a bit of notation. I use $\\mathbb{R}^+=[0,\\infty)$ for the nonnegative reals. For a space $X$ then $C_0(X)$, $C^\\infty(X)$, $C^\\infty_0(X)$, and $C^\\infty_K(X)$, represent the continuous real-valued functions on $X$ which are respectively vanishing at infinity, smooth, smooth and vanishing at infinity, and smooth with compact support. Let $(P_t)_{t\\geq 0}$ be the kernels\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n&P_t\\colon C_0(\\mathbb{R})\\to C_0(\\mathbb{R}),\\\\\\\\\n&P_tu(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi t}}\\int_\\mathbb{R}e^{-(x-y)^2/4t}u(y)\\,dy\n\\end{align}\n$$\nfor $t > 0$, and $P_0u=u$. This is the Markov transition function for Brownian motion (more precisely, for standard Brownian motion scaled by $\\sqrt{2}$, because of the normalization used here). For $u\\in C_K^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$, then $f(t,x)=P_tu(x)$ is in $C_0^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^+\\times\\mathbb{R})$, and is a solution to the heat equation with initial condition $f(0,x)=u(x)$, agreeing with the classical solution stated in the question. I'll also consider initial conditions $u\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty))$ (for $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$) by setting $u(x)\\equiv0$ for all $x\\le a$. The first step in the construction is to find initial conditions supported in $(a,\\infty)$ so that $P_tu(0)$ approximates any given continuous function of time that we like.\n\n1) For any $a > 0$ and $h\\in C_0((0,\\infty])$, there exists a sequence $u_1,u_2,\\ldots\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty))$ such that $\\sqrt{t}P_tu_n(0)$ converges uniformly to $h(t)$ (over $t > 0$) as $n\\to\\infty$.\n\nConsider the closure, $V$, in $C_0((0,\\infty])$ (under the uniform norm) of the space of functions $t\\mapsto\\sqrt{4\\pi t}P_tu(0)$ for $u\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty))$. Note that the limit as $t\\to\\infty$ does always exist and is just the integral of $u$. Then $V$ is a closed linear subspace of $C_0((0,\\infty])$. Consider a sequence $u_n\\in C_0((a,\\infty))$ tending to the delta function $\\delta_b$ at a point $b > a$, in the sense that $u_n$ all have support in the same compact set, and converge in distribution to $\\delta_b$. Then, from the expression defining $P_t$, $\\sqrt{4\\pi t}P_tu_n(0)$ converges uniformly over $t > 0$ to $\\exp(-b^2/4t)$. So, the function $t\\mapsto\\exp(-b^2/4t)$ is in $V$. As the set of functions of the form $t\\mapsto\\exp(-b^2/4t)$ for $b > a$ is closed under multiplication and separates points, the locally compact version of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem says that $V=C_0((0,\\infty])$. Then, (1) follows.\n\n2) For any $u\\in C^\\infty_K((0,\\infty))$ and $a,T > 0$, there exists a sequence $u_1,u_2,\\ldots\\in C^\\infty_0((a,\\infty))$ such that $f_n(t,x)\\equiv P_t(u+u_n)(x)$ converges uniformly to zero (along with all its partial derivatives to all orders) over $t\\in[0,T]$ and $x\\le0$.\n\nChoosing $0 < \\epsilon < a$ so that the support of $u$ is contained in $(\\epsilon,\\infty)$, (1) implies that we can choose $u_n\\in C^\\infty_K((a,\\infty)$ so that $\\sqrt{t}P_tu_n(\\epsilon)$ converges uniformly to $-\\sqrt{t}P_tu(\\epsilon)$ over $t\\ge0$ as $n\\to\\infty$. Then, $f_n(t,x)\\equiv P_t(u+u_n)(x)$ is a bounded solution to the heat equation with boundary conditions $f_n(0,x)=0$ for $x\\le\\epsilon$ and $f_n(t,\\epsilon)=P_t(u+u_n)(\\epsilon)$. It is then standard that the solution is given by an integral over the boundary,\n$$\nf_n(t,x)=\\int_0^t\\frac{\\epsilon-x}{\\sqrt{4\\pi (t-s)^3}}e^{-(\\epsilon-x)^2/4(t-s)}\\sqrt{s}P_s(u_n+u)(\\epsilon)\\frac{ds}{\\sqrt{s}}\n$$\nfor $x\\le0$. Differentiating this wrt $x$ and $t$ an arbitrary number of times, and using dominated convergence as $n\\to\\infty$, it follows that $f_n(t,x)$ (and all its partial derivatives) converge uniformly to zero over $x\\le0$ and $t\\in[0,T]$ as $n\\to\\infty$.\n\n3) Suppose that $T > 0$, $0 < a < b$ and $u\\in C^\\infty_K(\\mathbb{R})$ has support contained in $(-\\infty,-a)\\cup(a,\\infty)$. Then, there exists a sequence $u_n\\in C^\\infty_K(\\mathbb{R})$ with supports in $(-\\infty,-b)\\cup(b,\\infty)$ such that $P_t(u+u_n)(x)$ (and all its partial derivatives) tends to 0 uniformly over $\\vert x\\vert\\le a$ and $t\\in[0,T]$.\n\nSet $u^+(x)=1_{\\{x > 0\\}}u(x)$ and $u^-(x)=1_{\\{x < 0\\}}u(x)$. Applying (2) to $u^+(x+a)$, there exists a sequence $u^+_n\\in C^\\infty_K(\\mathbb{R})$ with supports in $(b,\\infty)$ such that $P_t(u^++u^+_n)(x)$ tends to 0 uniformly over $x\\le a$ and $t\\in[0,T]$. Applying the same argument to $u^-(-x-a)$, there exists $u^-_n\\in C^\\infty_K(\\mathbb{R})$ with support in $(-\\infty,-b)$ such that $P_t(u^-+u^-_n)(x)$ tends to zero uniformly over $x\\ge -a$ and $t\\in[0,T]$. A sequence satisfying the statement of (3) is $u_n=u^+_n+u^-_n$.\n\n4) If $u\\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R})$ then there exists $f\\in C^\\infty(\\mathbb{R}^+\\times\\mathbb{R})$ solving the heat equation with initial condition $f(0,x)=u(x)$.\n\nWe can inductively choose a sequence $u_n\\in C^\\infty_K(\\mathbb{R})$ such that $\\sum_{m=1}^nu_m(x)=u(x)$ for $\\vert x\\vert\\le n+1$ and $n\\ge1$. Let $u_1=u$ on $[-2,2]$ and then, for each $n\\ge2$, apply the following step.\n\nAs $\\tilde u=u-\\sum_{m=1}^{n-1}u_m$ is zero on $[-n,n]$, it has support in $(-\\infty,-a)\\cup(a,\\infty)$ for $a=n-1/2$.

Take $u_n=\\tilde u + v$.\n\nSetting $f_n(t,x)=P_tu_n(x)$, then $f_n$ are smooth functions satisfying the heat equation and the initial conditions $\\sum_{m=1}^nf_m(0,x)=u(x)$ for $\\vert x\\vert\\le n+1$. Also, by the choice of $u_n$, for $n > 1$ then $f_n$ together with all its derivatives up to order $n$ is bounded by $2^{-n}$ on $[0,n]\\times[1-n,n-1]$.

(This will tell you much more than you need to know for\nSerre's book, though.)\nFor a two page introduction to Galois representation theory,\nyou could read Mark Kisin's What is ... a Galois representation? for a two-page \nintroduction.\nYet another source is the Fermat's Last Theorem book (Cornell--Silverman--Stevens), which\nhas many articles related to Galois representations, some more accessible than others.\nThe article of Taylor that Chandan mentioned in a comment is also very nice, although it\nmoves at a fairly rapid clip if you haven't seen any of it before.\nSerre's article in Duke 54, in which he explains his conjecture about the modularity\nof 2-dimensional mod p Galois representations, is also very beautiful, and involves\nvarious concrete computations which could be helpful\nOne last remark: if you do want to understand Galois representations, you will need to have\na good understanding of the structure of the Galois groups of local fields (as described e.g. in Serre's book \"Local fields\"), in particular the role of the Frobenius element,\nof the inertia subgroup, and of the significance of tame and wild inertia.", "meta": {"post_id": 77278, "input_score": 41, "output_score": 61, "post_title": "Introductory text on Galois representations"}}

Can ordinary integration be related to this construction?", "output": "I prefer a somewhat different view of ends and coends, with the intuition stemming more from classical linear algebra and functional analysis. So for me an end is really an integral in a categorical sense.\nLet me explain it in more detail. The first fact about ends that show me their power and is basic in enriched category theory is the natural transformation lemma. Basically,\n$$Nat(F\\cdot; G\\cdot) = \\int_c Hom_C(Fc; Gc)$$\nThis equations shows that a global natural transformation is as if \"summed up\" from the local, \"differential\" transformations on each object. That's exactly what a natural transformation is: a coherent family of morphisms. In this way an end allows us to pass from the local to the global picture, just like a real integral. Let's consider a global section functor for sheaves:\n$$ \\Gamma(X; \\mathcal{F}) = Nat(\\Bbb{Z}, \\mathcal{F}) = \\int_U Hom_{Ab}(\\Bbb{Z}; \\mathcal{F}(U)) = \\int_{U\\in Ouv^{op}} \\mathcal{F}(U)$$\nCompare it with measure integration, where you have a (non-negative) measure defined for all measurable subsets of $X$ and you can, in principle, define the measure of $X$ analysing its subsets. At least for not-too-bad measure spaces you can find the measure of $X$ as the supremum of the subsets' measures. This can be also viewed as an end, if you consider a functor $M: Ouv \\to \\Bbb{R}_{+}$, where $\\Bbb{R}_{+}$ is a poset category with objects $[0;\\infty]$, $f:a\\to b \\iff a \\leqslant b$. However, I don't understand at the moment how can nontrivial general integrals be treated in this conext.\nEven more enlightening is the composition of distributors. A good account of distributors is in J. Benabou's article \"Distributors at work\". Informally, it is like a \"generalized functor\", the most important property being the existence of right adjoint for any functor considered as a distributor. Kan extensions also emerge miraculously. The name itself hints of this connection. A distributor is to a functor what a distribution is to a function. Formally, a (Set-valued) distibutor $F:A \\nrightarrow B$ from category $A$ to category $B$ is a functor $$\\hat F: A\\times B^{op} \\to Set$$\nA composition of distributors can be defined via Kan extensions along the Yoneda embedding, or much more neatly as a coend\n$$G\\circ F (a;c) = \\int^b \\hat G(b; c) \\times \\hat F(a;b)$$\nThis clearly reminds of matrix composition law. A simple example of (identity) distributor is the hom-functor in a V-category:\n$$[a;c] = \\int^b [b; c] \\otimes [a;b]$$\nClearly we just integrate out the dummy variable and the inner hom is just a change-of-coordinates Jacobian!\nA special case of these identities is the Yoneda lemma, which I will write as a left Kan extension:\n$$F(a) = \\int^c [c;a] \\otimes F(c) $$\nand the Kan extension itself:\n$$\\mathrm{Lan}_K(F)(a) = \\int^c [K(c);a] \\otimes F(c) $$\nClearly it's just a change of integration variables!\nAnother enlightening example comes from the theory of metric spaces, considered by F.W.Lawvere in \"Metric spaces, generalized logic, and closed categories\". A metric space is considered as a category enriched over $\\Bbb{R}_+$, defined above. The objects are points, hom from a to b is the distance from a to b (the metric need not be symmetric). In this case for $\\Bbb{R}_+$-valued functor $F$ it's limit is clearly it's supremum. A limit is an end\n$$\\mathrm{Lim} F = \\int_d F(d)$$\nwhere $F$ is considered as a bifunctor constant in its first variable. So\n$$\\sup_{x\\in X} F(x) = \\int_{x\\in X} F(x)$$\nA person familiar with tropical geometry and idempotent analysis will instantly recognise this formula as a tropical integral! Simple as it is, it is another exact shot for categorical integration. A Kan extension of $\\phi: X \\to \\Bbb{R}$ along $f:X\\to Y$ is\n$$\\mathrm{Ran}_{f} \\phi (y) = \\sup_x [ \\phi(x) - \\lambda Y(y, f(x)) ] $$\nIf not for the nonlinear hom nature, it would be immediately recognisable as a tropical Fourier transform, aka Legendre transform.\nEven the common integral itself can be considered as a kind of transfinite tensor product, but the construction is somewhat clumsy and eventually reduces to common measure, so it's not of much use practically but fits nicely in the categorical integration picture. As of yet I do not know any neat way to incorporate common integrals into the categorical framework, like tropical integrals do.\nSorry for a big post, but I just couldn't resist sharing these examples.", "meta": {"post_id": 78471, "input_score": 47, "output_score": 57, "post_title": "Intuition for coends"}}

{"input": "Writing a CV makes me paranoid that I'm failing to abide by unwritten rules. Of course CVs are flexible to capture the diversity of accomplishments someone might have. But there must be plenty of things a hiring committee absolutely expects. So I'm interested in anything that must be on a CV \u2014 whose omission would raise a red flag \u2014 of a mathematician looking for an academic job.\n\"Obvious\" answers are welcome. Even things which sound obvious like \"your name.\" What is obvious to someone who has read and evaluated lots of CVs is different from someone preparing one for the first time.  In your answer, please also be fairly specific about scope: have you served on hiring committees? for what types of positions? in the US or Europe or?\n(Note: As suggested in the comments, it is very good to ask people \"in the know\" directly for such career advice.  One reason for asking this question on MO is to have more open, less clubby answers \u2014 there is an echo chamber effect when you ask a bunch of people in the same subcommunity.)", "output": "From my perspective, the critical question isn't what must be included on your CV, but rather what mustn't, since that seems to be the more common problem (judging by the ones I see). What I'm about to describe is based on my experience at a U.S. research lab; I imagine it generalizes quite a bit beyond that, but I can't say how far, and it is certainly country-specific. \nI'll discuss five rules below, with some overlap between them. Of course these rules are not absolute (except for the last one), but you certainly shouldn't break them without thinking carefully about it and deciding there's a good reason to do so.\n(1) Your CV should represent you as a professional mathematician. Anything that is not relevant to your professional life should be left out. For example, you should generally not describe non-math-related summer or part-time jobs, hobbies, side interests outside of mathematics and related fields, etc. If there's something unusually interesting or impressive (you published a novel or are a chess champion) or that displays relevant skills (you write free software in your spare time), it's OK to mention it, but just briefly and not in a prominent position.\nI've seen some hair-raising violations of this rule, in which applicants devoted considerable space to things that have nothing to do with working as a mathematician. Nobody is going to reject your application just because you put something weird in your CV, but it's not good for your image as a professional.\n(2) Your CV shouldn't include anything unless you think the search committee might need or want to know it. For example, contact information is valuable, as is anything that can legitimately help judge your application. However, in the U.S. you should not list your age or birthdate, your marital status, information about your children, or your religion (unless you are applying to a religious institution). I realize this is common in some countries, and of course people will be understanding about that, but it comes across strangely to give people information they don't want and shouldn't be influenced by.\n(3) You should try not to seem desperate to impress, particularly with awards and distinctions. Some people provide enormous lists of very minor distinctions, sometimes with no relevance to research/teaching/service (for example, a college scholarship from a local business club). Coming across as insecure can make you seem less attractive: an ambitious department wants to hire people who are marginally too good for them, not people who are trying hard to be good enough. As a rule of thumb, when you get your Ph.D. and apply for your first job, it's OK to list any substantive distinction from grad school. You can list a few undergraduate honors, but only if they are impressive (Putnam fellow or major university-wide prize, yes; random scholarship, no). You shouldn't list high school honors at all (well, just maybe an IMO medal, but be careful not to look like you consider it your proudest achievement).\n(4) Be sure not to give the impression you are trying to obfuscate anything. I don't just mean you should tell the truth, but also that you should be clear and straightforward. For example, people sometimes feel bad about not having enough items to list in their publication or talk sections, and it can be tempting to reorganize the CV to try to obscure this. For example, you could replace the \"publications\" section with a \"research\" section in which you list not just publications but also talks and poster presentations, or even current/future research topics. This is a bad idea, since it can look like you are trying to make the information less accessible, and then everything on your CV will be looked at more skeptically. Instead, you want to make it easy to understand your CV and easy to see that you aren't doing anything tricky.\n(5) Don't lie. Don't say a paper will appear in a journal until it has been accepted, even if you are sure it will be. Don't say a paper is submitted until it is, even if you plan to submit it by the time the committee meets. Don't call something a preprint until it is written down and ready to distribute (you can say \"in preparation\" before then, but many people will ignore this since it is unverifiable). Don't say you have received a fellowship or prize if you haven't. You'd think all these things go without saying, but I've seen a couple of people get caught on one of them. You really don't want to be the person who gets asked for a copy of their preprint and can't produce one.", "meta": {"post_id": 79044, "input_score": 75, "output_score": 59, "post_title": "What items MUST appear on a mathematician's CV?"}}

(Strangely, if you do believe that, it means the shortest lattice vector problem should also be efficiently solvable, but it doesn't seem to tell you anything about discrete logarithms.  This puzzles me, since the parallels between factoring and discrete logs are also strong.)  It's also true that primality testing can be done in polynomial time, but that is a fundamentally different problem: when a modulus is prime, it has enormous consequences for modular arithmetic, and it is not difficult to test for primality by looking for those consequences, but the actual methods shed no light on factoring.\nOn the other hand, there is also no compelling evidence that factoring can't be done in polynomial time (see http://research.microsoft.com/~cohn/Thoughts/factoring.html for a little more detail about this).\nAt our current level of knowledge, I view the complexity of factoring as a matter of opinion, speculation, and wishful thinking, not principled arguments.  By contrast, there are exceedingly good reasons why the Riemann hypothesis should be true, and good reasons why P shouldn't equal NP.  I'm certainly open to arguments that fall far short of rigorous proof; I've just never heard a convincing one about the complexity of factoring.\nMy interpretation of Sarnak's belief isn't that he sees some good reasons other people don't appreciate.

Type and cotype are examples of such properties.  The (best) type and cotype of $L_p$ are calculated in many books.  I suggest you look at Theorem 6.2.14 in the book of Albiac and Kalton.

Hagis subsequently cited my work in a published paper, and it may be that others have just copied this citation without seeing the original.\nThe main innovation in my thesis over previous work is that I wrote a FORTRAN program to automate some of the algebraic manipulations that had previously been done by hand, making it practical to extend the previous result upwards. It still took several months on Middlebury's academic 16-bit PDP11-45 computer to finish all the computations. I managed to install the program to start as a low-priority background job whenever the computer restarted, and I programmed it to pick up from where it had left off.\nIf you have any other questions about the thesis, let me know and I might be able to answer them. :) Cheers, Jim\nMy answer to Arnie Dris's question below is too long to be entered as a comment, so I'm putting it here:\nI'm happy to help as I am able, although I've spent the 35 years since my BA thesis as a software developer and my number theory is a bit rusty! Also I don't have access to my thesis, or immediate access to the prior work it was based on. But I may still be able to answer your questions. The number theory part of my work was as explained by Peter Hagis Jr. and Wayne L. McDaniel in \"On the largest prime divisor of an odd perfect number.\" II, Math. Comp. 29 (1975), 922\u2013924. I did not attempt to add or subtract from the number theory analysis they had done. My only innovation was to automate by computer some of the algebra they had done by hand, which made it more practical to get a higher result.\nMy memory of this is a bit fuzzy, but I seem to recall that there were two rather tedious steps in the proof. The first involved some algebraic manipulations which Hagis and McDaniel did by hand and I did by computer. The second involved some more straightforward computations which they did by computer and so did I. If you have access to their paper, I expect that you will see what I mean as you read it. If this doesn't make sense on reading their paper, please let me know. I do live near a college that I expect would have the Mathematics of Computation, so I could go and reread their article. It might help to improve my memory! ;) Cheers, Jim", "meta": {"post_id": 83161, "input_score": 16, "output_score": 68, "post_title": "On J. T. Condict's Senior Thesis on Odd Perfect Numbers"}}

In contrast, Donaldson's invariants have been superseded by more easily computed invariants. This is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs for such a far-reaching topological result, particularly as it is so regularly used in proof-by-contradiction arguments against results in smooth 4-manifold theory. \nAs the Bing topologists familiar with these arguments retire, the hopes of reproducing the details of the proof are fading, and with it, the insight that such a spectacular proof affords.

The infinite construction using gropes, which we call a skyscraper, simplifies several key steps of the proof, and the known extensions of the theory to the non-simply connected case rely on this approach. \u2026\n\nWe briefly indicate, for the experts, the salient differences between the proof given in this book and that given in [FQ90]. First, there is a slight change in the definition of towers (and therefore of skyscrapers). \u2026\n\nAdditionally, the statement of the disc embedding theorem in [FQ90] asserts that immersed discs, under certain conditions including the existence of framed, algebraically transverse spheres, may be replaced by flat embedded discs with the same boundary and geometrically transverse spheres. The proofs given in [Fre82a, FQ90] produce the embedded discs but not the geometrically transverse spheres. We remedy this omission by modifying the start of the proof given in [FQ90], as in [PRT20]. \u2026 Besides these points, the proof of the disc embedding theorem given in this book only differs from that in [FQ90] in the increased amount of detail and number of illustrations.\n\nIn Section 1.5 they mention some things that are not covered in the book. In addition to bypassing the part of Freedman's original proof that \"consisted of embedding uncountably many compactified Casson handles within the original Casson handle and then applying techniques of decomposition space theory and Kirby calculus,\" they say:\n\nNote that the ambient manifold is required to be smooth in the statement of the disc embedding theorem. There exists a category preserving version of the theorem, where \u2018immersed\u2019 discs in a topological manifold are promoted to embedded ones. However, the proof requires the notion of topological transversality and smoothing away from a point (see Section 1.6).

The background to this question is an identity I found involving $x^{10}+11x^5-1$.

This in fact is the Brioschi quintic form which the general quintic can be reduced into. Two of the polynomials are easily recognizable as icosahedral invariants, while $r^6+2r^5-5r^4-5r^2-2r+1$ is a factor of $r^{30}+522r^{25}-10005r^{20}-10005r^{10}-522r^5+1$.\nSo other than in formulas using Ramanujan's continued fractions, I wondered where else those polynomials appear.

The problem is that even if the result were to follow from a Frey curve argument and a potential theorem of the form \"all sufficiently nice Galois representations come from automorphic forms\", we're a long way from establishing such a theorem.\nA few more details: a key problem is that there are two natural candidates for where the automorphic forms will come from, and neither is good enough. The first is the group $GL(2)/\\mathbf{Q}(i)$. This is a very natural place to look, but the problem is that this group does not admit Shimura varieties, so it's very hard to even go the \"easy\" way and to attach a Galois representation to an algebraic automorphic representation (i.e. do what Deligne did), let alone to do what Wiles did. There are some theorems of this nature, but they all have a self-duality hypothesis built into them, which will not hold for the Tate module of the Frey curve in general.\nThe second place to look is rank 2 unitary groups for the extension $\\mathbf{Q}(i)/\\mathbf{Q}$. These do have Shimura varieties and their geometry is understood fairly well nowadays, and there are are very strong theorems attaching Galois representations to these automorphic forms (there are even very strong theorems for rank $n$ unitary groups nowadays -- see for example the book by Harris and Taylor, but things have moved on even further since then, e.g. because of recent work of Sug-Woo Shin). However we then run into the same problem -- the unitary groups have some extra symmetry and this means that the associated Galois representations have some extra symmetry (they need to be essentially conjugate self-dual), and this extra symmetry will not in general be true for the Galois representations attached to the Tate module of the Frey curve.\nSo one needs a good new idea before we can push forward what one might call \"Wiles' strategy\" in this situation.\nThis is in marked contrast to the case of totally real fields, where a lot of the machinery works fine and it would not surprise me nowadays if FLT could be proved for several totally real fields. As has been implicitly mentioned in the comments, Jarvis and Meekin did this for $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, and this was a few years ago now, and modularity lifting theorems have moved on tremendously since then, so it would not surprise me if the experts could prove these results for other totally real number fields now. However somehow, after the Jarvis-Meekin work, which is a proof that the machine can be made to work in other cases, perhaps the interesting question now is not something like \"is FLT true for $\\mathbf{Q}(\\sqrt{5})$?\" (which one could perhaps hope to answer, perhaps with a lot of work, but with basically existing methods and a lot of hard graft to deal with the small $n$ cases) but more like \"is some slightly weakened version of FLT true for all totally real fields?\" or some such thing. You need to weaken it a bit because the case $n=3$ is an elliptic curve and it has positive rank for lots of totally real $F$, so now you need to deal with $n=4$ and $n=9$ and $n=6$ by hand, or just declare that you're only interested in $x^p+y^p=z^p$ with $p\\geq5$ prime; and then you'll sometimes get reducible mod $p$ Galois representations -- so perhaps the correct weakening is something like \"$x^p+y^p=z^p$ has no solutions for $p$ sufficiently large (depending on $F$)\". Even then there may be problems in \"case 2\".\nMy impression is that the machinery being developed now is not really being developed with generalisations of FLT in mind, but it's generalising this \"Wiles machine\" in different directions, for example to prove things like the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture and the Sato-Tate conjecture. This is the direction deemed \"trendy\" -- and in a sense I can see why, because is FLT over a specific number field other than the rationals really a \"natural\" question? And FLT over a general number field is obviously false, so now you have to weaken things etc etc. On the other hand hard conjectures like Sato-Tate do look to me like natural questions.\nIMPORTANT EDIT: I wrote this answer a long time ago -- what is it, 9 days now? -- but life moves on, and I hear from my spies in Toronto that Richard Taylor yesterday announced some results joint with Harris, Lan and Thorne, where they claim that they can attach Galois representations to (not necessarily self-dual) cohomological cuspidal automorphic representations on $GL(n)$ over totally real and CM fields. In particular apparently the theory for $GL(2)/\\mathbf{Q}(i)$ is now up to about the state that the theory for $GL(2)/\\mathbf{Q}$ was in the late 60s.

Isn't the prescribed double complex exactly the same one I'd have written down if I'd never heard of derived categories?", "output": "1 Easy\nProposition Let $f:X\\to Y$ be a continuous map of topological spaces, $\\mathscr F$ a sheaf of abelian groups on $X$ such that $R^jf_*\\mathscr F=0$ for $j>0$.

Doing it that way is not much harder than the above, but perhaps a bit less \"automatic\". \nFurthermore, this proof shows more: Not only the cohomologies of these sheaves are isomorphic, but they come from the same complex! That's a much stronger statement. It is easy to give examples when the cohomologies of two complexes are isomorphic, but the complexes are not. I suppose one may argue that the word \"natural\" in the statement means exactly this, but then I'd say that proving naturality with the Leray spectral sequence is certainly possible, but it definitely needs more care.\nThis last point is actually an important one regarding the derived category language. You get a higher level notion. The fact that you can work with the complex whose cohomologies give the derived functors of your original functor is very very useful. \n\n2 Less Easy\nIn case you were not convinced by the above example, here is one that should do the trick:\nA special case of Grothendieck duality says that if $f:X\\to Y$ is a proper morphism between not too horrible schemes, let's say finite type over a field $k$ (let me not try to make a precise statement, this is in Residues and Duality that you mentioned) and $\\mathscr F$ is a coherent sheaf on $X$, then \n$$\n Rf_*R\\mathscr Hom_X(\\mathscr F, \\omega_X^{\\bullet})\\simeq R\\mathscr Hom_Y(Rf_*\\mathscr F, \\omega_Y^{\\bullet}).\n$$\nHere $\\omega_{Z}^{\\bullet}=\\varepsilon^!k$ is \"the\" dualizing complex where $\\varepsilon: Z\\to \\mathrm{Spec}\\ k$ is the structure map of $Z$. \nNow try to imagine how one could state this using spectral sequences. Both sides actually correspond to spectral sequences, so the statement would be something like \"there is a natural map between this an this spectral sequences, such that they converge to the same thing\". \nI would argue that already the statement of this theorem would be tiring in the language of spectral sequences, but using it would be pure pain.\n\n3 Even Less Easy\nHere is an application of Grothendieck duality where one can see how the derived category formalism makes life easier and arguments that seemed complicated are reduced to a one liner.\nTheorem (a.k.a. Kempf's Criterion)\nLet $Y$ be a normal variety over $\\mathbb C$ with a resolution of singularities $f:X\\to Y$. Then $Y$ has rational singularities (i.e., $R^if_*\\mathscr O_X=0$ for $i>0$) if and only if \n\n$Y$ is Cohen-Macaulay\n$f_*\\omega_X\\simeq \\omega_Y$\n\nProof Let $n=\\dim Y=\\dim X$ and suppose $Y$ has rational singularities.

In order to get the spectral sequences you do not need to go through the derived category formalism. However, if you are indeed \"recovering\" the spectral sequence, then you start with the derived category formalism. In other words, if you've never heard of derived categories, why (or perhaps more importantly how) would you want to recover anything from a derived category statement?

Am I missing something fundamental?", "output": "There's no paradox here: you did the same calculation in two different ways and got the same answer, as you should.  The issue is how to think about gimbal lock.\nHow should you represent a rotation in three dimensions?  You can try using Euler angles to represent it using three rotation angles, but there's something fishy about this.  That naturally parametrizes a three-dimensional torus, but the rotation group is not a torus (rather, it's a projective space).  It doesn't even have a torus as a covering space, but rather a 3-sphere.  So the problem is that the naive coordinates just don't give the right topology, and therefore something must go wrong in degenerate cases to fix the topology.  Gimbal lock is essentially a name for what goes wrong.\nWhen people say quaternions avoid gimbal lock, they mean the unit quaternions naturally form a 3-sphere, so there are no topology issues and they give a beautiful double cover of the rotation group (via a very simple map).  Keeping track of a unit quaternion is fundamentally a more natural way to describe a rotation than keeping track of three Euler angles.\nOn the other hand, if you describe your quaternion via Euler angles, then gimbal lock shows up again, not in the quaternions themselves but in your coordinate system for them.  That's what you are seeing in your calculations: you are doing a standard calculation to see the effects of gimbal lock, and then redoing the same calculation using quaternions.\nSome explanations of gimbal lock don't distinguish clearly between the underlying geometry/topology and the choice of coordinates, which has always annoyed me, since that's essential for understanding what's going on mathematically.", "meta": {"post_id": 95902, "input_score": 31, "output_score": 66, "post_title": "The gimbal lock shows up in my quaternions"}}

Well known proofs (e.g. via triangulations, or Morse theory) yield the same classification because of results that connect these categories for surfaces. Informally speaking, here is what I know to be true for compact connected surfaces\n\n[TOP & PL]. Topological surfaces always admit a triangulation, and any two triangulations of a surface are piecewise-linear equivalent (Hauptvermutung for surfaces)\n\n[DIFF & PL (without using 1.)].

This paper considers the case of non-compact triangulable surfaces without boundary.\nThank you!", "output": "I have come to believe that answering the questions I posted would be more enlightening if I try to provide an overview of the larger context that they are part of.\nThe literature treating and generalizing the topics mentioned in the post for surfaces is as extensive as it is interesting. The 1960's and 70's were times of very active research in this part of topology, and it still is today. Three wonderful resources are\nKirby & Siebenmann's book Foundational Essays on Topological Manifolds, Smoothings and Triangulations, Milnor's paper Differential Topology Forty-six Years Later, and A. Ranicki's slides. I will refer to these as [KS], [Mil2011] and [Ran], respectively. Also, a word on notation: uniqueness will mean up to PL, DIFF or TOP homeomorphism, depending on the category at hand. Unless otherwise stated, words like manifold or surface will have general meaning (i.e. possibly with boundary and possibly non-compact). Finally, a list of references is included at the bottom.\n\n[DIFF & PL] (Strictly speaking PL and DIFF are not comparable. One uses the category PDIFF, which is equivalent to PL. However, this distinction is not normally made unless technicalities may require so.) Differentiable manifolds admit canonical PL structures. A differentiable manifold can be triangulated uniquely up to PL equivalence. S.S. Cairns first proved this result for compact $C^{1}$ manifolds, including those having a finite number of boundary components (See [Cai1934], [Cai1936]), although he generalized these results later (see [Cai1961]). J.H.C. Whitehead proved it for $C^{1}$ manifolds without boundary (see [Whi1940]), and J. Munkres finally included $C^{r}$ manifolds with boundary, $1\\le r\\le\\infty$ (see [Mun1966] or Theorem 3.10.2 in [TL]).\n\nA given PL structure on a topological manifold may have compatible differentiable structures that are inequivalent. That is, $$\\mathrm{DIFF}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{PL}$$ is not injective. In [Mil1956] J. Milnor gave an example of a manifold PL-homeomorphic to the usual 7-dimensional sphere $S^{7}$, but not diffeomorphic to it. In fact, it is known that for $n\\neq 4$ a topological $n$-sphere admits a unique PL structure (For $n\\le 3$ see [Moi1977] or [TL], for $n\\ge 5$ is due to Smale and can be found in [Sma1962]. The case $n=4$ is an open question). Therefore, the inequivalent differentiable structures that Milnor constructed in [Mil1956] are all compatible with the usual PL structure on $S^{7}$.\nEven more, on the topological manifold $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ it is possible to define uncountably many inequivalent PL or differentiable structures. An excellent account of this exotic $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$'s can be found in Chapter XIV of [Kir1989].\nThe functor above is also not surjective. That is, there are PL manifolds that do not admit a compatible differentiable structure. M. Kervaire gave such an example in [Ker1960]. Later, J. Ells and N.H. Kuiper (see [EK1961]), and I. Tamura (see [Tam1961]) gave examples in dimension 8, the lowest possible.\nIn dimensions 7 or less, PL manifolds always admit compatible differentiable structure, and in dimensions 6 or less this happens in an a unique way (See Theorem 2 in [Mil2011] and Theorem 3.10.8 and Problems 3.10.19-20 in [TL] for dimension up to three). In this sense, DIFF=PL for manifolds of dimension $n\\leq 6$, which means that the number of inequivalent differentiable structures on a topological 4-sphere is also unknown.\nThe obstruction to finding a differentiable structure on a given PL manifold is called the Munkres-Hirsch-Mazur obstruction (see the last paragraph on [Mil2011]).\n\n[TOP & PL] $$\\mathrm{PL}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{TOP}$$ is neither surjective nor injective. Indeed, there are topological manifolds, such as Freedman's E8 manifold, that do not admit a PL structure, or are even triangulable even if we allow non-PL triangulations. (A proof of this now follows from the proof of the 3-dimensional Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, which implies that any triangulation of a 4-dimensional manifold is necessarily a PL-triangulation).\n\nThe exotic $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$'s mentioned above provide an example of a topological manifold having uncountably many inequivalent PL structures. This disproves the manifold version of the Haupvermutung. The non-manifold version of the Haupvermutung was disproven by J. Milnor ([Mil1961]), who found two homeomorphic compact simplicial complexes that are not PL homeomorphic.\nIn dimension $3$ or less, the Haupvermutung is true (see Chapters 35 & 36 in [Moi1977] or Thurston/Levy's book). In this sense PL=TOP for manifolds of dimension $n\\le 3$. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, except possibly for $n=4$ there is only one $n$-dimensional PL sphere.\nThe obstruction to finding a PL structure on a given topological manifold culminated with the resuts of Kirby and Siebenmann (the Kirby\u2013Siebenmann class). (see [KS] and Theorem 1 in [Mil2011]).\n\n[TOP & DIFF] As John Klein points out in the comments, smoothing a topological manifold is in general a question formulated by first putting a combinatorial structure on the manifold (normally a handlebody structure or a PL structure). That is, $$\\mathrm{DIFF}\\rightarrow \\mathrm{TOP}$$ is nothing but the composition of the previous two functors and is therefore neither surjective nor injective.\n\nIndeed, the examples of Kervaire, Ells & Kuiper and Tamura mentioned above yield topological manifolds having no differentiable structure. However, these are still PL manifolds.\nMore striking is the E8 manifold which, not being triangulable, cannot have a differentiable structure. It provides and example of a topolgical manifold of dimension four that admits neither PL nor differentiable structures.\nThe exotic $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$'s mentioned earlier give an example of a topological manifold having uncountably many inequivalent differentiable structures. Another example given above are Milnor's non-diffeomorphic $S^{7}$ spheres.\nIn dimension 3 or less the results above yield DIFF=PL=TOP.\nComing back to surfaces I want to point out that Theorem 8.3 in [Moi1977] shows that every surface is triangulable. At the begining of the proof it is shown that triangulations and PL structures are equivalent structures on a surface. Moreover, Theorem 8.5 is the Haupvermutung for surfaces. Therefore, a complete classification of non-compact surfaces (with boundary) seems to have been achieved by the results contained and mentioned in  Prishlyak and Mischenko's paper.\nFinally, I want to point out that the result that two smooth surfaces are diffeomorphic iff they are homeomorphic is due to J. Munkre's and can be found in his dissertation Some Applications of Triangulation Theorems, U. of Michigan, 1955. The proof uses the triangulation theorems proven by E.E. Moise, who was Munkres' advisor.\nREFERENCES:\nThe references [KS], [Mil2011] and [Ran] are listed (with links) right at the beginning, in the second paragraph above.\n[Cai1934] Cairns, S.

You could certainly argue that there is insufficient management, but that's not the same thing.\nPeople are also asking about the policy by which papers are labelled as having text overlap with other papers.  A clearer statement of that policy would be useful, but that is a separate question from Olga's case.\n\nAccording to e-mail that I just saw, this morning Olga was given the option of reverting the previous arXiv paper to Part I and submitting Part II separately.  Her answer, according to what I saw, was that she elected to keep it as a replacement after all.  I am mentioning this so that readers who see arXiv postings this week won't think that injustice continues.\nI stand by my explanation that the stock e-mail that she was sent didn't fit the facts, and that her appeal should not have been stonewalled.  (In fact her appeal was soon seriously considered internally, but that was not explained.)  However, in the original posting, Olga's name was withheld supposedly to protect her interests.

Is this still true (that is, conjectured) for Maass forms of higher weight?  Or do they \"turn $\\ell$-adic\" in higher weight?", "output": "Here's some piece of the bigger picture. Maass forms and holomorphic modular forms are both automorphic representations for $GL(2)$ over the rationals. An automorphic representation is a typically huge representation $\\pi$ of an adele group (in this case $GL(2,\\mathbf{A})$, with $\\mathbf{A}$ the adeles of $\\mathbf{Q}$). Because the adeles is the product of the finite adeles and the infinite adeles, this representation $\\pi$ is a product of a finite part $\\pi_f$ and an infinite part $\\pi_\\infty$. The infinite part is a representation of $GL(2,\\mathbf{R})$ (loosely speaking -- there are technicalities but they would only cloud the water here). \nThe representation theory of $GL(2,\\mathbf{R})$, in this context, is completely understood. The representations basically fall into four categories, which I'll name (up to twist):\n1) finite-dimensional representations (these never show up in the representations attached to cusp forms).\n2) Discrete series representations $D_k$, $k\\geq2$ (these are the modular forms of weight 2 or more).\n3) The limit of discrete series representation $D_1$ (these are the weight 1 forms).\n4) The principal series representations (these are the Maass forms).\nNow what does Langlands conjecture? He makes a conjecture which does not care which case you're in! He conjectures the existence of a \"Galois representation\" attached to $\\pi$, and this is a \"Galois representation\" in a very loose sense: it is a continuous 2-dimensional complex representation of the conjectural \"Langlands group\", attached to $\\pi$. Note that there should be a map from the Langlands group to the Galois group, and in the case of Maass forms and weight 1 forms Langlands' representation should factor through the Galois group. For modular forms of weight 2 or more Langlands' conjecture has not been proved and in some sense it is almost not meaningful to try to prove it because no-one can define the group. In particular Deligne did not prove Langlands' conjecture, he proved something else.\nSo Clozel came along in 1990 and tried to put Deligne's work into some context and he came up with the following: he formulated the notion of what it meant for $\\pi_\\infty$ to be algebraic (in fact there are two notions of algebraic, which differ by a twist in this context, so let me write \"$L$-algebraic\" to make it clear which one I'm talking about) and conjectured that if $\\pi$ were $L$-algebraic then there should be an $\\ell$-adic Galois representation $\\rho_\\pi$ attached to $\\pi$. Maass forms with eigenvalue $1/4$, and holomorphic eigenforms, are $L$-algebraic, and the $\\ell$-adic Galois representation attached to the Maass forms/weight 1 forms is just the one you obtain by fixing an isomorphism $\\mathbf{C}=\\overline{\\mathbf{Q}}_\\ell$. I should say that Clozel worked with $GL(n)$ not $GL(2)$ and also worked over an arbitrary number field base.\nWhether or not the image of $\\rho_\\pi$ is finite is something which is conjecturally determined by $\\pi_\\infty$: you can read it off from the infinitesimal character of $\\pi_\\infty$ and also from the local Weil group representation attached to $\\pi_\\infty$ by the local Langlands conjectures, which are all theorems (of Langlands) for real reductive groups.\nPut within this context your question becomes purely local: one has to figure out what Clozel's recipe gives in each case to get a handle on what your question is asking. You're asking about principal series representations. If you work out Clozel's recipe in these cases you find that if $\\lambda\\not=1/4$ then $\\pi_\\infty$ is not $L$-algebraic (and so we don't even expect a representation of the Galois group, we just expect a representation of the conjectural Langlands group), and if $\\lambda=1/4$ then, up to twist, we expect the image to be always finite, because, well, that's what the calculation gives us.\nI learnt this by just doing all these calculations myself. I wrote them up in brief notes at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/maths/research/notes/automorphic_forms_for_gl2_over_Q.pdf and http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/maths/research/notes/local_langlands_for_gl2R.pdf (both available from http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/maths/research/notes/index.html ).\nSo why is there this asymmetry? Well actually this asymmetry is not surprising because it is predicted on the Galois side as well. If you look at an irreducible mod $p$ ordinary Galois representation which is odd then its universal ordinary deformation is often known to be isomorphic to a Hecke algebra of the type defined by Hida (so in particular we get lots of interesting $\\ell$-adic Galois representations with infinite image). In particular its Krull dimension should be 2 (and this was already known to Mazur in the 80s). But the calculations for these Krull dimensions involve local terms, and the local term at infinity depends on whether the representation is odd or even. If you consider deformations of an even Galois representation then the calculations come out differently and the Krull dimension comes out one smaller. In particular one only expects to see finite image lifts, plus twists of such lifts by powers of the cyclotomic character. \nSo in summary you see differences on both sides -- the automorphic side and the Galois side -- and they match up perfectly! You don't expect $\\ell$-adic representations to show up in the Maass form story and yet things are completely consistent anyway.\nToby Gee and I recently tried to figure out the complete conjectural picture about how automorphic representations and Galois representations were related. Our conclusions are at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/maths/research/papers/bgagsvn.pdf . But for $GL(n)$ this was all due to Clozel over 20 years ago (who would have known all those calculations that I linked to earler; these are all standard).", "meta": {"post_id": 98915, "input_score": 25, "output_score": 46, "post_title": "Are there Maass forms where the expected Galois representation is $\\ell$-adic?"}}

Since the $T^j0$ are dense in $[0,1)$, we need to ask how many blocks $f(x)\\ldots f(T^{k-1}x)$ are possible.\nConsider taking $x=0$ and moving it around the circle (=$[0,1)$) once. As you move it, the $T^ix$ also each move around the circle one time. The sequence changes each time one of the $(T^ix)_{0\\le i< k}$ crosses 0 or 1/2. This is a total of $2k$ changes.

After all, the former is locally one function of $2$ variables while the latter is locally three functions of $2$ variables.  It would be remarkable if $K$ determined $g$, even up to isometry, and, of course, except for constant $K$, it does not, as the arguments of Weinstein and Kulkarni show.\nMeanwhile, if one regards the curvature $\\mathsf{R}(g)$ of of the Levi-Civita connection of the metric $g$  on a surface $M$ as a section of the rank $3$ bundle $\\bigl(T\\otimes T^\\ast)_0\\otimes \\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)={\\frak{sl}}(T)\\otimes \\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)$, then the equation $\\mathsf{R}(g) = {\\mathsf{R}}_0$ for a given nonzero section ${\\mathsf{R}}_0$ of ${\\frak{sl}}(T)\\otimes \\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)$ is a determined second-order equation for $g$.  (Here, I am writing \"$T$\" for \"$TM$\", etc., to save space.) This then becomes a more reasonable question, one that has an easy answer:  Namely, if $M$ is compact and connected and $g_1$ and $g_2$ are metrics on $M$ such that $\\mathsf{R}(g_1) = \\mathsf{R}(g_2)$ and such that these curvature tensors are nowhere vanishing, then $g_2 = c g_1$ for some constant $c>0$, and conversely.  The reason for this is simple:  If ${\\mathsf{R}}_0$ is a nonvanishing section of ${\\frak{sl}}(T)\\otimes \\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)$, then requiring that $\\mathsf{R}(g) = {\\mathsf{R}}_0$ determines the conformal class of $g$ purely algebraically (because using $g$ to 'lower the first index' of ${\\mathsf{R}}_0$ has to result in a tensor that is skewsymmetric in the first two indices).  Thus, if $\\mathsf{R}(g_1) = \\mathsf{R}(g_2) = {\\mathsf{R}}_0$, where the latter is nonvanishing, then $g_2 = e^u\\ g_1$ for some function $u$ on $M$.  Plugging this back into the equation $\\mathsf{R}(g_1) = \\mathsf{R}(g_2)$ and computing shows that $u$ must be harmonic with respect to the conformal structure determined by $g_1$ (which is also the conformal structure determined by $g_2$).  If $M$ is compact and connected, then $u$ has to be constant.\nAs Misha points out, in higher dimensions, the situation is rather different and is well-described in the works of Kulkarni and Yau that he cites.  However, just qualitatively, it's worth pointing out that specifying the sectional curvature of a metric is generally a very overdetermined problem in higher dimensions, which is why the rigidity results of Kulkarni and Yau should not be surprising.\nTo see the nature of this, recall that the Riemann curvature tensor $\\mathsf{Rm}(g)$ of a metric $g$ on $M$ is got from $\\mathsf{R}(g)$ by 'lowering an index'. By the first Bianchi identity, $\\mathsf{Rm}(g)$ is a section of the subbundle ${\\mathsf{K}}(T^\\ast)\\subset {\\mathsf{S}}^2\\bigl(\\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)\\bigr)$ that is the kernel of the natural map\ninduced by wedge product\n$$\n\\mathsf{S}^2\\bigl(\\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)\\bigr)\\to \\Lambda^4(T^\\ast)\n$$\nIn fact, this map has a natural $\\mathrm{GL}(T)$-equivariant right inverse, so that one has a canonical bundle splitting\n$$\n\\mathsf{S}^2\\bigl(\\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)\\bigr) = {\\mathsf{K}}(T^\\ast)\\oplus \\Lambda^4(T^\\ast)\n$$\nand these two subbundles are $\\mathrm{GL}(T)$-irreducible.  (I'm using $\\mathrm{GL}(T)$ to denote the 'gauge' group of bundle automorphisms of $T = TM$.  I don't say that it's great notation, but it will be OK for this discussion.)  An important interpretation of this splitting is the following one:  Obviously, one can regard a section of $\\mathsf{S}^2\\bigl(\\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)\\bigr)$ as a quadratic form on the bundle $\\Lambda^2(T)$.  Then the elements of $\\Lambda^4(T^\\ast)\\subset \\mathsf{S}^2\\bigl(\\Lambda^2(T^\\ast)\\bigr)$ are exactly the quadratic forms that vanish on all of the decomposable elements in $\\Lambda^2(T)$, i.e., the elements of the form $x\\wedge y$ for $x,y\\in T_xM$ for some $x$.  In particular, a section $Q$ of ${\\mathsf{K}}(T^\\ast)$ is completely determined by its values on the 'cone bundle' $\\mathsf{C}\\subset \\Lambda^2(T)$ that consists of the decomposable elements.\nNow, any metric $g$ on $M$ determines a unique section $\\Lambda^2(g)$ of ${\\mathsf{K}}(T^\\ast)$ with the property that \n$$\n\\Lambda^2(g)\\bigl(x\\wedge y\\bigr) = |x\\wedge y|^2_g = g(x,x)g(y,y)-g(x,y)^2,\n$$\nand the sectional curvature of $g$ is simply the function $\\sigma_g:\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T)\\to\\mathbb{R}$ defined as the ratio\n$$\n\\sigma_g\\bigl([x\\wedge y]\\bigr) \n= \\frac{\\mathsf{Rm}(g)\\bigl(x\\wedge y\\bigr)}{\\Lambda^2(g)\\bigl(x\\wedge y\\bigr)}\n\\quad\\text{for $x,y\\in T_xM$ with $x\\wedge y\\not=0$},\n$$\nwhere we regard $\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T)$ as the projectivization of the cone bundle $\\mathsf{C}$.\nThe fact that the sectional curvature function is the ratio of two quadratic forms that are sections of $\\mathsf{K}(T^\\ast)$ shows that it is a very constrained function on $\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T)$.  In fact, unless the sectional curvature is constant on $\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T_x)$, the numerator and denominator of this ratio at $x\\in M$ are uniquely determined up to a common multiple.  In particular, the set of such functions on $\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T)$ can be regarded as the set of sections of a bundle over $M$ whose fibers are isomorphic to a space of dimension $d_n = \\tfrac12 n(n{+}1) + \\tfrac1{12}n^2(n^2-1) -1$ that is singular along the $1$-dimensional curve of constant functions.  \nIn particular, specifying a candidate sectional curvature function $\\sigma:\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T)\\to\\mathbb{R}$ that is not constant on any fiber $\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T_x)$ is equivalent to specifying $d_n$ functions of $n$ variables for the $\\tfrac12 n(n{+}1)$ coefficients of $g$, which is highly overdetermined when $n>2$.  This is why one has the level of rigidity for the sectional curvature that is indicated in Kulkarni's and Yau's results.  In fact, as this analysis shows, if $\\sigma_{g_1} = \\sigma_{g_2} = \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is not constant on any fiber $\\mathsf{Gr}(2,T_x)$, then one must have $g_2 = e^u g_1$ for some function $u$ on $M$ and that function $u$ will have to satisfy $\\mathsf{Rm}(e^u g_1) = e^{2u} \\mathsf{Rm}(g_1)$ which is, itself, a very highly overdetermined second order equation for the single function $u$.   (It's kind of remarkable that there are any nonflat metrics $g$ that admit nonzero solutions $u$ to $\\mathsf{Rm}(e^u g) = e^{2u} \\mathsf{Rm}(g)$ at all, even without the compactness assumption.  That is what makes Yau's counterexample in dimension $3$ so interesting.  Indeed, though, it turns out that, up to constant scaling and diffeomorphism, there is exactly a $1$-parameter family of such exceptional metrics in dimension $3$, so they are extremely rare indeed. )\nThe upshot of all these observations is that specifying a nonconstant sectional curvature function $\\sigma_g$ in dimensions above $2$ very nearly determines $g$ in all cases, so that, except for a very small set of degenerate cases, the sectional curvature does, indeed, determine the metric.  However, it's such an overdetermined problem that this result is not all that surprising.\nIn particular, specifying $\\sigma_g$ is specifying a greater quantity of information about $g$ than specifying, say, $\\mathsf{Rm}(g)$.  When $n>3$, even specifying $\\mathsf{Rm}(g)$ is overdetermined, and, generally speaking, you'd expect $\\mathsf{Rm}(g)$ to determine $g$ as well when $n>3$.  \nWhen $n=3$, specifying $\\mathsf{Rm}(g) = \\mathsf{R}$ is locally $6$ second order equations for $6$ unknowns, so it's a determined system.   Back in the 80s, by using the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem, I showed that, when $\\mathsf{R}$ is appropriately nondegenerate and real-analytic, the equation $\\mathsf{Rm}(g) = \\mathsf{R}$ is locally solvable for $g$, and the general solution depends on $5$ functions of $2$ variables.  Later, Dennis DeTurck and Deane Yang proved this result in the smooth category as well (see Local existence of smooth metrics with prescribed curvature, in Nonlinear problems in geometry (Mobile, Ala., 1985), 37--43, Contemp. Math., 51, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1986).\nIn higher dimensions, the natural determined curvature problem is to specify the Ricci tensor $\\mathsf{Rc}(g)$ as a section of $S^2(T^\\ast)$ (or some trace-modified version of it), and, there, Dennis DeTurck has the best results.", "meta": {"post_id": 100281, "input_score": 43, "output_score": 53, "post_title": "Does the curvature determine the metric?"}}
{"input": "I will begin by giving a rough sketch of my understanding of motives.\nIn many expositions about motives (for example, http://www.jmilne.org/math/xnotes/MOT102.pdf), the category of motives is defined to be a category such that every Weil cohomology (viewed as a functor) factors through it. This does not define the category uniquely, nor does it imply that it exists.\nThere are two concrete candidates that we can construct. The category of Chow motives, which is well-defined, is trivially a category of motives. However, it has some bad properties. For example, it is not Tannakian. The second candidate is the category of numerical motives. It too is well-defined, however it is only conjectured that it is category of motives (i.e., that every Weil cohomology factors through this category). This conjecture is closely related to (or perhaps even equivalent to?) Grothendieck's standard conjectures. That would be desirable, because the category of numerical motives is very well-behaved.\nFurthermore, the original motivation for motives is that Grothendieck has proven that if the category of numerical motives is indeed a category of motives, then the Weil conjectures are correct.\nSo far, even though I a murky on many of the details, I follow the storyline.\nQuestion\nWhere does \"motivic cohomology\" (in the sense of, for example, http://www.claymath.org/library/monographs/cmim02.pdf) fit into this story?\nI know that motivic cohomology has something to do with Milnor K-theory, but that is more or less where my understanding of the context of motivic cohomology ends. If motives are already an abstract object that generalizes cohomology, what does motivic cohomology signify? What is the motivation for defining it? What is the context in which it arose?", "output": "Classically, Grothendieck's motives are only the pure motives, meaning abelian-ish things which capture the (Weil-cohomology-style) $H^i$ of smooth, projective varieties.  To see the relationship with motivic cohomology, one should extend the notion of motive so that non-pure (i.e. \"mixed\") motives are allowed, these mixed motives being abelian-ish things which capture the $H^i$ of arbitrary varieties.  The main novelty with mixed motives is that the (conjectural) abelian category of them is not semi-simple -- in fact every mixed motive should be a (generally non-trivial) iterated extension of pure motives, these extensions essentially coming from compactification and resolution of singularities, as in the story of mixed Hodge structures.\nThen once one thinks of mixed motives, a natural direction of study (or speculation, as the case may be...) is that of determining all possible extensions (or iterated extensions) between two motives.  And that's what motivic cohomology is, essentially:  the study of these Ext groups.  More formally, every variety $X$ should determine an object $C(X)$ in the bounded derived category of mixed motives, collecting together all the various mixed motives $H^i(X)$, and the $(i,j)^{th}$ motivic cohomology of $X$ is (up to twisting conventions) the abelian group of maps from the unit object to $C(X)$ \\ $[i](j)$ (the $j^{th}$ Tate twist of the $i^{th}$ shift of $C(X)$) in the derived category of mixed motives.\nNow, there are a few points to make here.  The first is that, though the above motivation and definition of motivic cohomology rely on an as-yet-conjectural abelian category of mixed motives, one can, independently of any conjectures, define a triangulated category which, as far as anyone can tell, behaves as if it were the bounded derived category of this conjectural abelian category.  The most popular such definition, because of its simplicity and relative workability, is Voevodsky's.  So the basic theory and many basic results on motivic cohomology are unconditional.\nAnother thing to say is that, as always, matters with motives are illuminated by considering realization functors.  Let me single out the $\\ell$-adic etale realization, since its extension from pure to mixed motives is straightforward (unlike for Hodge structures): any mixed motive, just as any pure motive, yields a finite-dimensional $\\ell$-adic vector space with a continuous action of the absolute Galois group of our base field.  It then \"follows\" (in our conjectural framework... or actually follows, without quotation marks, in Voevodsky's framework) that the $(i,j)^{th}$ motivic cohomology of X maps to the abelian group of maps from the unit object to $C^{et}(X)$ \\ $[i](j)$ in the bounded derived category of $\\ell$-adic Galois representations.  But this abelian group of maps is just the classical (continuous) $\\ell$-adic etale cohomology $H^i(X(j))$ of the variety $X$, making this latter group the natural target of an $\\ell$-adic etale \"realization\" map from motivic cohomology.\nSo here comes the third point:  note that this is the etale cohomology of $X$ itself, not of the base change from $X$ to its algebraic closure.  So this etale cohomology group mixes up arithmetic information and geometric information, and the same is true of motivic cohomology in general.  (Think especially of the case $X=pt$: the motivic cohomology of a point admits a generally nontrivial realization map to the $\\ell$-adic Galois cohomology of the base field.)  For example, it is expected (e.g. by Grothendieck -- see http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/motives.pdf for this and more) that for an abelian variety $A$ over an ``arithmetic'' base field $k$, the most interesting part of the motivic cohomology $H^{(2,1)}(A)$ (again my twists may be off...), by which I mean the direct summand which classifies extensions of $H^1(A)$ by $H^1(G_m)$, should identify with the rationalization of the abelian group of $k$-rational points of the dual abelian variety of $A$, the map being given by associating to such $k$-rational point the mixed motive given as $H^1$ of the total space of the corresponding $G_m$-torsor on $A$.  And in this case, the above \"realization\" map to $\\ell$-adic etale cohomology is closely related to the classical Kummer-style map used in the proof of the Mordell-Weil theorem.\nSo in a nutshell: motivic cohomology is very related to motives, since morally it classifies extensions of motives.  But it is of a different nature, since it is an abelian group rather than an object of a more exotic abelian category; and it's also quite different from a human standpoint in that we know how to define it unconditionally.  Finally, motivic cohomology realizes to Galois cohomology of a variety itself, rather than to the base change of such a variety to the algebraic closure.\nHope this was helpful in some way.", "meta": {"post_id": 102839, "input_score": 65, "output_score": 77, "post_title": "What is the relationship between motivic cohomology and the theory of motives?"}}

He asked if I could prove the converse, I said no, and we both agreed that it would be nice to prove it.

I will be grateful for any hint.", "output": "Well, by Cayley--Hamilton, each matrix $A\\in {\\rm GL}(n,p)$ generates an at most $n$-dimensional subalgebra ${\\mathbb F}_p[A]\\subseteq M(n,p)$ thus containing at most $p^n-1$ nonzero elements. Hence the order of $A$ cannot exceed $p^n-1$.\nOn the other hand, consider a degree $n$ monic polynomial $P_n$ whose root is a generator $\\xi$ of ${\\mathbb F}_{p^n}^*$. Then a matrix with $P_n$ as its characteristic polynomial has order at least $p^n-1$ since $\\xi$ is its eigenvalue.\nADDENDUM. if you wish the order to be the power of $p$, then the answer is $d=p^{\\lceil \\log_p n\\rceil}$. Since the order of $A$ is divisible by the multiplicative orders of its eigenvalues, all the eigenvalues should be $1$. Hence the characteristic polynomial is $(x-1)^n$, so $A^d-I=(A-I)^d=0$.\nOn the other hand, if $A=I+J$ is the Jordan cell of size $n$ (with eigenvalue 1), then $A^{d/p}=I^{d/p}+J^{d/p}\\neq I$, but $A^d=I+J^d=I$.\nNB. The subgroup of all (upper-)unitriangular matrices is a Sylow $p$-subgroup in ${\\rm GL}(n,p)$. So you may concentrate on it when looking at the elements of this kind.\nADDENDUM-2 (much later). This is to answer the question in the comments about the maximal order of an element $f\\in AGL(n,q)$, where $q$ is a power of $p$. Write $f(x)=Ax+b$.\nIf $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $A$, then $f$ has a fixed point (the equation $f(x)=x$ has a solution), so we may regard it as an element of $GL(n,q)$, and the maximal order of $f$ is again $q^n-1$.\nSo we are concerned with the case when the minimal polynomial $\\mu(x)$ of $A$ vanishes at $1$, say $\\mu(x)=(x-1)^k\\nu(x)$, where $\\nu(1)\\neq 0$. Then $A$ is similar to a block-diagonal matrix with blocks having minimal polynomials $(x-1)^k$ and $\\nu(x)$ (in view of $\\mathbb F_q^n=\\mathop{\\mathrm {Ker}}(A-I)^k\\oplus\\mathop{\\rm Ker}\\nu(A)$). So the order $d$ of $A$ does not exceed $p^{\\lceil\\log_p k\\rceil}(q^{n-k}-1)$ if $n<k$, and $p^{\\lceil\\log_p n\\rceil}$ otherwise. If $n>3$ (or $n=3$ and $q>2$), one may easily see that this bound does not exceed $q^{n-1}-1$. So $f^d$ is a translation, which yields that $f^{pd}=\\mathord{\\rm id}$, and $pd\\leq p(q^{n-1}-1)<q^n-1$. Thus the maximal order of $f$ in these cases is still $q^n-1$.\nWe are left with the cases $n=1$, $n=2$, or $n=3$, $p=2$. When $n=1$, the answer is obviously $\\max(p,q-1)$. When $n=2$, the only case left is $d=p=q$ achieved when $A$ is similar to the Jordan cell $\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}$. In this case, $f^p(x)=x+(A^{p-1}+\\dots+I)b=x$ unless $p=2$, when $f^2(x)=x+\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{pmatrix}b$. So the answer is still $q^2-1$ when $q>2$, and $4$ otherwise.\nFinally, if $n=3$ and $q=2$, then the order of $A$ having eigenvalue $1$ exceeds 3 only if $A$ is similar to $3\\times 3$ Jordan cell (then $d=4$); but in this case $f^4=\\mathord{\\rm id}$. So this is not an exception.\nSumming up, the only cases when the order may be greater than $q^n-1$ are: (1) $n=1$, $q=p$ (the maximal order is $p$), and (2) $n=2$, $q=2$ (the maximal order is $4$).", "meta": {"post_id": 109483, "input_score": 21, "output_score": 48, "post_title": "maximal order of elements in GL(n,p)"}}

In fact, it is easy to construct power series converging on the circle of convergence, but are unbounded. For example,\n$$\nf(z)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\frac1{n^5(1+in^{-3}-z)}\n$$\ndefines a function whose power series expansion has radius of convergence 1 and converges everywhere on the unit circle, but is unbounded in a neighbourhood of 1.\nA method of constructing such functions is as an infinite sum\n$$\nf(z)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_n(z).\n$$\nHere, $f_n(z)$ are chosen to have a power series expansion converging everywhere on the closed unit ball. Let $f^{(r)}_n(z)$ denote the sum of the first $r$ terms in the power series expansion of $f_n$. We need to arrange it so that $f^{(r)}(z)\\equiv\\sum_nf_n^{(r)}(z)$ converges on the closed unit ball, and that $f(z)=\\lim_{r\\to\\infty}f^{(r)}(z)$ holds. That is, we need to be able to commute the limit $r\\to\\infty$ with the summation over $n$. A sufficient condition to be able to do this is that $\\sum_n\\sup_r\\lvert f^{(r)}_n(z)\\rvert < \\infty$, for all $\\lvert z\\rvert\\le1$. That this allows us to commute the summation with the limit is just a special case of dominated convergence.\nNext, to ensure that $f(z)$ is unbounded on the unit ball, we want to choose $f_n$ such that there exists $q_n$ in the closed unit ball with $f_n(q_n)$ large, and such that it does not get cancelled out in the summation, so that $f(q_n)$ is large and diverges as $n\\to\\infty$.\nFor example, choose positive reals $\\delta_n,\\epsilon_n$ tending to zero, and setting $a_n=1+i\\epsilon_n$, and\n$$\nf_n(z)=\\frac{\\delta_n}{a_n-z}=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\delta_na_n^{-m-1}z^m.\n$$\nThese are all well-defined as power series with radius of convergence greater than 1. Furthermore, the partial sums are\n$$\nf^{(r)}_n(z)=\\delta_n\\frac{1-(z/a_n)^r}{a_n-z},\n$$\nwhich are bounded by $2\\delta_n/\\lvert a_n-z\\rvert$. As $a_n\\to1$, this is bounded by a multiple of $\\delta_n$ for each fixed $z\\not=1$, so the dominated convergence condition is satisfied when $\\sum_n\\delta_n$ is finite. On the other hand, if $z=1$, then $\\lvert a_n-z\\rvert=\\epsilon_n$, so the dominated convergence condition is satisfied everywhere whenever $\\sum_n\\delta_n/\\epsilon_n$ is finite.\nNext, $f_n(z)$ achieves its largest value on the unit ball at $q_n=a_n/\\lvert a_n\\rvert$, and its real part there is given by\n$$\n\\Re f_n(q_n)=\\frac{\\delta_n}{\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon_n^2}(\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon_n^2}-1)}\\ge\\frac{2\\delta_n}{\\epsilon_n^2\\sqrt{1+\\epsilon_n^2}}.\n$$\nAs $f_m(z)$ has positive real part for all $m$, this bound also holds for $f(q_n)$, and we get that $f$ is unbounded whenever $\\delta_n/\\epsilon_n^2\\to\\infty$. These conditions are satisfied by taking $\\epsilon_n=n^{-3}$ and $\\delta_n=n^{-5}$.\nAlternatively, for an example closer to Sierpinski's, consider choosing a sequence $a_n\\to1$ on the unit circle and positive reals $K_n$, and set\n$$\nf_n(z)=K_n2^{-n}\\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}a_n^{2^n-1-k}z^k=2^{-n}K_n\\frac{a_n^{2^n}-z^{2^n}}{a_n-z}.\n$$\nThe partial sums of the power series expansion of $f_n(z)$ are bounded by $2^{1-n}K_n/\\lvert a_n-z\\rvert$, so the dominated convergence condition is satisfied for $z\\not=1$ so long as $\\sum_n2^{1-n}K_n$ is finite. Sierpinski chooses $a_n=(n^2-1+2ni)/(n^2+1)$ so that $a_n-1$ goes to zero at rate $1/n$. The dominated convergence condition is therefore satisfied whenever $\\sum_n2^{-n}K_nn$ is finite.\nNow, $f_n(z)$ is maximized at $z=a_n$ where $\\lvert f_n(a_n)\\rvert=K_n$. So,\n$$\n\\lvert f(a_n)\\rvert\\ge K_n-\\sum_{m\\not=n}\\frac{2^{1-m}K_m}{\\lvert a_m-a_n\\rvert}.\n$$\nAs $a_m-a_n$ is bounded below by a multiple of $1/m^2$, the summation on the right is bounded whenever $\\sum_m2^{-m}K_mm^2$ is finite, and $f(a_n)$ is unbounded if we also take $K_n$ going to infinity. Sierpinski takes $K_n=n^2$ here. Finally, in Sierpinski's example, he multiplies $f_n$ by $z^{2^n}$.

In conjunction with Numbers 4 and 6, it allows us to reach a major milestone in our series\u2014the completion of the proof of the following theorem:\n\n\nTheorem O: Let G be a finite simple group of odd type, all of whose proper simple sections are known simple groups. Then either G is an alternating group or G is a finite group of Lie type defined over a field of odd order or G is one of six sporadic simple groups.\n\n\nPut another way, Theorem O asserts that any minimal counterexample to the classification of the finite simple groups must be of even type. The work of Aschbacher and Smith shows that a minimal counterexample is not of quasithin even type, while this volume shows that a minimal counterexample cannot be of generic even type, modulo the treatment of certain intermediate configurations of even type which will be ruled out in the next volume of our series.\n\nEDIT February 2021 Volume 9 has now been published.  From the preface:\n\nThis book contains a complete proof of Theorem $\\mathcal{C}_5$, which covers the \u201cbicharacteristic\u201d subcase of the $e(G) \\ge 4$ problem. The outcome of this theorem is that $G$ is isomorphic to one of the six sporadic groups for which $e(G)\\ge 4$, or one of six groups of Lie type which exhibit both characteristic 2-like and characteristic 3-like properties. Finally, in Chapter 7, we begin the proof of Theorem $\\mathcal{C}_6$ and its generalization Theorem $\\mathcal{C}^\u2217_6$, which cover the \u201c$p$-intermediate\u201d case. $\\ldots$ In the preceding book in this series, we had promised complete proofs of Theorems $\\mathcal{C}_6$ and $\\mathcal{C}^\u2217_6$ in this book, but because of space considerations, we postpone the completion of those theorems to the next volume.\n\nEDIT September 2021\nIn response to a question from Hugo de Garis, Ron Solomon sent the following email in January 2021:\n\nVol. 9 is already submitted, accepted and scheduled for publication. It should be published early this year.\nAs for the rest, my best guess now is that there will in fact be 4 further volumes, not 3.  A roughly 800 pages manuscript on the Uniqueness Theorem has been completed by Gernot Stroth.  With some additional material, it will fill 2 further volumes. This could probably be readied for publication by a year from now.  However, our team (Inna Capdeboscq, Richard Lyons, Chris Parker and myself) are currently focussing on the remaining work to be done for the other two volumes.  It is difficult to estimate how long this will take. With luck we might have a first draft completed this calendar year, but it might take longer.\nIt is safe to say that the remaining volumes will not all be published before 2023.  I hope it is also safe to say that they will all be published no later than 2025.\n\n(Emphasis added)\nEDIT 29 Dec 2021\nRichard Lyons maintains an erratum for the whole published second generation CFSG on this page: https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~lyons/cfsg/\nEDIT 05 Apr 2022\nIn response to a further question from de Garis (see the page linked above), Solomon wrote (in March 2022):\n\nWe have been working on the theorems for both Volumes 10 and 11.  Just in the past few weeks, we have decided to concentrate on the completion of Volume 10.  This is proceeding very well and we should be able to submit Volume 10 for publication this year, I believe.  I fear that I may have been a bit overoptimistic in predicting the completion of all the volumes by the end of 2024.\n\nEDIT 09 Mar 2023\nFrom a 23 January 2023 article about Inna Capdeboscq (emphasis added):\n\nThe expected length of the Generation-2 proof is of about 5,000 pages published in 12 volumes. At this moment Volumes 1 through 9 are published. Inna has been involved in the Generation-2 project for several years, providing small contributions to Volume 6 and 7. Inna co-authored the recently published Volume 9 and is currently in a process of completing Volume 10.\n\nI don't know how this estimate of 12 volumes sits with Solomon's email from January 2021 (see the Sept '21 edit) saying there would be 4 more volumes after vol 9 was done. And though Stroth's future contribution is mentioned in the short article, I don't think this count of 12 includes his manuscript mentioned above.\nEDIT 24 June 2023\nI emailed Richard Lyons to double check how things are going given the hopeful progress on volume 10, mentioned above. He replied (and he and Ron Solomon gave permission to relay this):\n\nVolume 10 has been submitted for publication.\nI have received Stroth's final manuscript for the Uniqueness Case, which\nwe plan to make the final volume.\n[Ron] Solomon and I are currently working on Volume 11, the penultimate volume (provided that it fits into one volume .. it is not clear at this time whether it will or not). This will complete the proof of Theorem C_4 (the last of the seven in the Classification Grid) and begin the treatment of the Uniqueness Case for groups of even type, to mesh with\nStroth's work.\n\nSo it seems Stroth will contribute one volume, to go at the end, and we will have volume 11 (and maybe vol 12) of the main series before that. So 11+2+1 (or 12+2+1) volumes in total. [edit: the +2 is the Aschbacher\u2013Smith work, the +1 is Stroth]\nEDIT 9 October 2023\nCommenter colt_browning points out below that Volume 10 is due for publication 26th December, and is now available for preorder: https://bookstore.ams.org/surv-40-10. The title is The Classification of the Finite Simple Groups, Number 10: Part V, Chapters 9\u201317: Theorem $C_6$ and Theorem $C^*_4$, Case A, with listed authors Capdeboscq, Gorenstein, Lyons and Solomon, and it's 570 pages long.\n\nThis book is the tenth in a series of volumes whose aim is to provide a complete proof of the classification theorem for the finite simple groups based on a fairly short and clearly enumerated set of background results. Specifically, this book completes our identification of the simple groups of bicharacteristic type begun in the ninth volume of the series (see Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, Volume 40.9). This is a fascinating set of simple groups which have properties in common with matrix groups (or, more generally, groups of Lie type) defined both over fields of characteristic 2 and over fields of characteristic 3. This set includes 11 of the celebrated 26 sporadic simple groups along with several of their large simple subgroups. Together with SURV/40.9, this volume provides the first unified treatment of this class of simple groups.\n\nTotal length of volumes 1\u201310 is 4511 pages, and Aschbacher and Smith's two volumes fill 1320 pages. Maybe another 1000\u20131500 pages to go? There's an old manuscript of Stroth from the late 90s that seems to cover the \"uniqueness case\" (first listed article on this page), which is what his volume will cover. That's 244 pages, but it's not clear how it relates to the draft of what will become the last volume of the published second generation proof.", "meta": {"post_id": 114943, "input_score": 63, "output_score": 41, "post_title": "Where are the second- (and third-)generation proofs of the classification of finite simple groups up to?"}}
{"input": "Liouville's theorem from complex analysis states that a holomorphic function $f(z)$ on the plane that is bounded in magnitude is constant. The usual proof uses the Cauchy integral formula. But this has always struck me as indirect and unilluminating. There is a proof via harmonic function theory, but this also seems to involve an unnecessarily large amount of prior buildup. So one might seek a more direct proof as below.\nAssume that $f(z)$ is nonconstant. The fact that $f(z)$ is holomorphic at every point implies that at any given point, there is a direction such that moving in that direction makes $|f(z)|$ larger. But this doesn't prove that $|f(z)|$ is unbounded, because a priori its magnitude could behave like $5 - \\frac{1}{|z|}$ or some such thing. \nIn the case of $f(z) = \\frac{1}{P(z)}$ where $P(z)$ is a polynomial, one knows that $|f(z)|$ tends toward $0$ as $|z| \\to \\infty$ so that there's some closed disk such that if $|f(z)|$ is bounded, then it has a maximum in the interior of the disk, which contradicts the fact that one can always make $f(z)$ larger by moving in a suitable direction. But for general $f(z)$, one doesn't have this argument.\nOne can try to reason based on the power series expansion of a holomorphic function $f(z)$ that is not a polynomial. Because polynomials are unbounded as $|z| \\to \\infty$ and grow in magnitude in a way that's proportional to their degree, one might think that a power series, which can be regarded as an infinite degree polynomial, would also be unbounded as $|z| \\to \\infty$. This is of course false: take $f(z) = \\sin(z)$, then as $|z| \\to \\infty$ along the real axis, $f(z)$ remains bounded. The point is that the dominant term in the partial sums of the power series varies with $|z|$, and that the relevant coefficients change, alternating in sign and tending toward zero rapidly, so that the gain in size corresponding to moving to the next power of $z$ is counterbalanced by the change in coefficient. But there's some direction that one can move in for which $f(z)$ is unbounded: in particular, for $f(z) = \\sin(z)$, $f(z)$ is unbounded along the imaginary axis.\nThis suggests that we write $a_n = s_{n}e^{i \\theta_n}$ for the coefficient of $z^n$ in the power series expansion of $f(z)$ and write $z = re^{i \\theta}$ (where $s, r > 0$) so that\n$$f(z) = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} {a_n}z^n = \\sum_{n = 0}^{\\infty} sr^n e^{n\\theta + \\theta_n}  $$\nand try to find a function $\\theta = g(r)$ such that $f(z)$ is unbounded as $r \\to \\infty$ if one takes $\\theta = g(r)$. \nBut I don't know what to do next.

{"input": "Let $E \\to F$ be a morphism of cohomology theories defined on finite CW complexes. Then by Brown representability, $E, F$ are represented by spectra, and the map $E \\to F$ comes from a map of spectra. However, it is possible that the map on cohomology theories is zero while the map of spectra is not nullhomotopic. In other words, the homotopy category of spectra does not imbed faithfully into the category of cohomology theories on finite CW complexes. This is due to the existence of phantom maps: \nLet $f: X \\to Y$ be a map of spectra. It is possible that $f$ is not nullhomotopic even if for every finite spectrum $F$ and map $F \\to X$, the composite $F \\to X \\stackrel{f}{\\to} Y$ is nullhomotopic. Such maps are called phantom maps. For an explicit example, let $S^0_{\\mathbb{Q}} = H\\mathbb{Q}$ be the rational sphere. This is obtained as a filtered (homotopy) colimit of copies of $S^0$ and multiplication by $m$ maps. The universal coefficient theorem shows that there are nontrivial maps $S^0_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\to H \\mathbb{Z}[1]$; in fact they are parametrized by $\\mathrm{Ext}^1(\\mathbb{Q}, \\mathbb{Z}) \\neq 0$. However, these restrict to zero on any of the terms in the filtered colimit (each of which is a copy of $S^0$).\nIn other words, the distinction between flat and projective modules is in some sense an algebraic analog of the existence of phantom maps. Given a flat non-projective module $M$ over some ring $R$, then there is a nontrivial map in the derived category $M \\to N[1]$ for some module $N$. Now $M$ is a filtered colimit of finitely generated projectives -- Lazard's theorem -- and the map $M \\to N[1]$ is \"phantom\" in that it restricts to zero on each of these finitely generated projectives (or more generally for any compact object mapping to $M$). \nSo it should not be too surprising that phantom maps of spectra exist and are interesting. \nNow spectra are analogous to the derived category of $R$-modules, but spectra also come with another adjunction: \n$$ \\Sigma^\\infty, \\Omega^\\infty: \\mathcal{S}_* \\leftrightarrows \\mathcal{Sp}$$\nbetween pointed spaces and spectra.  They thus come with another distinguished class of objects, the suspension spectra.

The other conjectures were proved by Dwork and Grothendieck. According to Wikipedia, Deligne gave a second proof, and then mentions three more proofs.

More precisely, Laumon gives a shorter proof of theorem 3.2.3 of Deligne's \"La conjecture de Weil II\" that doesn't use section 2 of that paper, but he still needs results from section 1 (the calculation of the monodromy of lisse sheaves on curves in 1.8 and the fact that \"most\" irreducible lisse sheaves are pure proved in 1.5.1). Once you have theorem 3.2.3, it is pretty easy to deduce the rest of the \"full package\" from it, so Laumon doesn't say anything about that.\nKatz's proof : Katz gives a simpler proof of theorem 3.2.3 of Deligne's Weil II paper, or rather of a weakening of it that is enough to deduce the Riemann hypothesis and hard Lefschetz. It is not enough to deduce the full package immediately, although this can be done without too much pain. I am not very familiar with Katz's proof. It seems to be different from Deligne's and Laumon's proofs but to use the same kind of techniques as Deligne's proof. My impression is that it is more concrete that Deligne's proof.\n(Note : I am not convinced that the difference between \"just the Riemann hypothesis\" and \"the full package\" is so big. The reason is that, if you know the Riemann hypothesis, then you should be able to deduce the full package for complexes of geometric origin. But global Langlands tells us that, over a smooth curve over a finite field, every irreducible lisse sheaves is of geometric origin up to twisting by a rank 1 sheaf. So in a way everything is of geometric origin. The situation is very different over a number field, of course.)\nKedlaya's proof : It is supposed to be modeled on Deligne's second proof modulo the simplification of Laumon, but of course the actual technical are different because Kedlaya uses p-adic coefficients. Also, he got the Riemann hypothesis but not the full package, because at the time the theory of relative p-adic coefficients was not fully developed. But now it is !\nAbe and Caro's proof : See http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0662\nThey develop the theory of weights for overholonomic D-modules with Frobenius structure on varieties over finite fields and obtain a full Weil II package for them (and even the Asterisque 100 extension, ie the theory of weights for perverse sheaves).

That is, one assumes that the number in question is rational/algebraic, and constructs some quantity that can be shown to be bounded away from 0, less than 1, and also an integer.  To get these estimates, one typically needs some rapidly converging series expansion that is closely related the number of interest. For example the reason that Fourier's proof that $e$ is irrational is so simple is that we have a ready-made rapidly converging series $\\sum 1/n!$ for $e$ that allows us to  construct an integer between 0 and 1 from the assumption that $e$ is rational.  As for numbers like $\\pi$ or $e^\\pi$, they basically piggyback on the rapidly converging series $\\exp z = \\sum z^n/n!$ because $\\exp(i\\pi) = -1$.\nIn general, the less obvious it is how to relate your number to a suitable rapidly converging series, the harder it will be to prove irrationality/transcendence.

Later progress on $\\zeta(2n+1)$, particularly by Rivoal and Zudilin, relies on taking various subtle linear combinations of them in order to eventually deduce the nonexistent integer between 0 and 1, and so are only able to prove that at least one of a set of zeta values is irrational.\nSo could there be another proof that Euler missed out there, based on an elementary but non-obvious identity for $\\gamma$ that has the right properties for the usual machinery to grind through?\nMaybe, but currently there is no method in sight for relating $\\gamma$ in the right way to a suitable rapidly converging series.

I'd like to better understand what kinds of arithmetic information it contains. I've been unable to answer number theorists who've asked me this before. A related question is about what information is contained in $K(S)$ where $S$ is the sphere spectrum.\nI am aware of Vandiver's Conjecture and that it is equivalent to the statement that $K_n(\\mathbb{Z})=0$ whenever $4 | n$.

Quillen-Lichtenbaum seems related to $K(\\mathbb{Z})$, but it seems it would tell us things about $K(\\mathbb{Z})$ not the other way around.

There's a survey written by Weibel on the history of the field, and that includes some problems it's solved (e.g. the congruence subgroup problem) but other than Quillen-Lichtenbaum I can't see anything which relies on $K(\\mathbb{Z})$ as opposed to $K(R)$ for other rings. If $K(\\mathbb{Z})$ could help compute $K(R)$ for general $R$ then that would be something I've love to hear about.", "output": "$\\newcommand\\Z{\\mathbf{Z}}$\n$\\newcommand\\Q{\\mathbf{Q}}$\nI'm a number theorist who already thinks of the algebraic $K$-theory of $\\Z$ as part of number theory anyway, but let me make some general remarks.\nA narrow answer: Since (following work of Voevodsky, Rost, and many others) the $K$-groups of $\\Z$ may be identified with Galois cohomology groups (with controlled ramification) of certain Tate twists $\\Z_p(n)$, the answer is literally \"the information contained in the $K$-groups is the same as the information contained in the appropriate Galois cohomology groups.\"\nTo make this more specific, one can look at the rank and the torsion part of these groups.  \n\nThe ranks (of the odd $K$-groups) are related to $H^1(\\Q,\\Q_p(n))$ (the Galois groups will be modified by local conditions which I will suppress), which is related to the  group of extensions of (the Galois modules) $\\Q_p$ by $\\Q_p(n)$. A formula of Tate computes the Euler characteristic of $\\Q_p(n)$, but the cohomological dimension of $\\Q$ is $2$, so there is also an $H^2$ term. The computation of the rational $K$-groups by Borel, together with the construction of surjective Chern classes by Soul\u00e9 allows one to compute these groups explicitly for positive integers $n$. There is no other proof of this result, as far as I know (of course it is trivial in the case when $p$ is regular).\nThe (interesting) torsion classes in $K$-groups are directly related to the class groups of cyclotomic extensions. For example, let $\\chi: \\mathrm{Gal}(\\overline{\\Q}/\\Q) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{F}^{\\times}_p$ be the mod-$p$ cyclotomic character. Then one can ask whether there exist extensions of Galois modules:\n\n$$0 \\rightarrow \\mathbf{F}_p(\\chi^{2n}) \\rightarrow V \\rightarrow \\mathbf{F}_p \\rightarrow 0$$\nwhich are unramified everywhere. Such classes (warning: possible sign error/indexing disaster alert) are the same as giving $p$-torsion classes in $K_{4n}(\\Z)$. The non-existence of such classes for all $n$ and $p$ is Vandiver's conjecture. Now we see that:\nThe finiteness of $K$-groups implies that, for any fixed $n$, there are only finitely many $p$ such that an extension exists. An, for example, an explicit computation of $K_8(\\Z)$ will determine explicitly all such primes (namely, the primes dividing the order of $K_8(\\Z)$). As a number theorist, I think that Vandiver's conjecture is a little silly --- its natural generalization is false and there's no compelling reason for it to be true. The \"true\" statement which is always correct is that $K_{2n}(\\mathcal{O}_F)$ is finite.\nRegulators. Also important is that $K_*(\\Z)$ admits natural maps to real vector spaces whose image is (in many cases) a lattice whose volume can be given in terms of zeta functions (Borel). So $K$-theory is directly related to problems concerning zeta values, which are surely of interest to number theorists. The natural generalization of this conjecture is one of the fundamental problems of number theory (and includes as special cases the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, etc.). There are also $p$-adic versions of these constructions which also immediately lead to open problems, even for $K_1$ (specifically, Leopoldt's conjecture and its generalizations.)\nA broader answer: A lot of number theorists are interested in the Langlands programme, and in particular with automorphic representations for $\\mathrm{GL}(n)/\\Q$. There is a special subclass of such representations (regular, algebraic, and cuspidal) which on the one hand give rise to regular $n$-dimensional geometric Galois representations (which should be irreducible and motivic), and on the other hand correspond to rational cohomology classes in  the symmetric space for $\\mathrm{GL}(n)/\\Q$, which (as it is essentially a $K(\\pi,1)$) is the same as the rational cohomology of congruence subgroups of $\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\Z)$. Recent experience suggests that in order to prove reciprocity conjectures it will also be necessary to understand the integral cohomology of these groups. Now the cohomology classes corresponding to these cuspidal forms are unstable classes, but one can imagine a square with four corners as follows:\n stable cohomology over $\\mathbf{R}$: the trivial representation.\n unstable cohomology over $\\mathbf{R}$: regular algebraic automorphic forms for $\\mathrm{GL}(n)/\\Q$.\n stable cohomology over $\\mathbf{Z}$: algebraic $K$-theory.\n unstable cohomology over $\\mathbf{Z}$: ?\"torsion automorphic forms\"?, or at the very least, something interesting and important but not well understood.\nFrom this optic, algebraic $K$-theory of (say) rings of integers of number fields is very naturally part of the Langlands programme, broadly construed.\nFinal Remark:  algebraic K-theory is a (beautiful) language invented by Quillen to explain certain phenomena; I think it is a little dangerous to think of it as being an application of \"homotopy theory\". Progress in the problems above required harmonic analysis and representation theory (understanding automorphic forms), Galois cohomology, as well as homotopy theory and many other ingredients.

{"input": "My understanding of purity theorems is that they come in several flavors:\n1) Those of the form \"this Galois representation is pure, i.e. the eigenvalues of $Frob_p$ are algebraic numbers all of whose absolute values have size $p^{w/2}$\". I don't think that this is the kind of purity I'm interested in.\n2a) Purity in algebraic geometry 1: on a smooth algebraic variety the ramification locus of a morphism is a pure codimension 1 subvariety (Zariski, Nagata etc).\n2b) Purity in algebraic geometry 2: absolute cohomological purity. Basically -- if $Y$ is a pure codimension $d$ subscheme of $X$ then the local cohomology groups $H^i_Y(X,\\mathbf{Z}/n\\mathbf{Z})$ should vanish away from $i=2d$ (under various hypotheses, e.g. $X$ locally Noetherian, $n$ invertible everywhere etc) and should be $\\mathbf{Z}/n\\mathbf{Z}$ etale locally if $i=2d$ (SGA5, Gabber etc).\n\nFaltings proved an \"almost purity theorem\" and I think that I'm supposed to be regarding it as some sort of analog of a purity theorem above. Faltings' work occurs in the context of \"almost mathematics\", where one is working over the integers $R$ in a certain type of (non-discrete) valuation ring $K$, so $R$ has a maximal ideal $m$ and the idea is that instead of working in the category of $R$-modules, one works in the category of $R$-modules up to $m$-torsion (some localised category); this is the category of \"almost $R$-modules\". \nFaltings' almost purity theorem (or perhaps some beefed-up version due to Scholze) says something like this:\nTheorem: If $K$ is a perfectoid field, $A$ is a perfectoid $K$-algebra, and $B/A$ is finite etale, then $B$ is also perfectoid and $B^o/A^o$ is almost finite etale.\nWhatever does this have to do with the purity theorems mentioned at the beginning of this post?", "output": "This is really just an elaboration of Emerton's comment: You should read Mark Kisins' review of Faltings's paper \"Almost etale extensions\".\nBut I wanted to elaborate: Faltings regards the almost purity theorem as an analogue of Zariski-Nagata purity. In Faltings's original setup, it was formulated as follows. Consider the rings\n$$ R_m = \\mathbb{Z}_p[p^{1/p^m},T_1^{\\pm 1/p^m},...,T_n^{\\pm 1/p^m}]\n$$\nEach of them is smooth over $\\mathbb{Z}_p[p^{1/p^m}]$ (in particular regular), and the transition maps are finite and etale after inverting $p$. Let $S_0$ be a finite normal $R_0$-algebra, which is etale after inverting $p$, and let $S_m$ be the normalization of $S_0\\otimes_{R_0} R_m$. The idea is that there is ramification of $S_0$ in the special fibre, and you want to get rid of it, by adjoining the chosen tower of highly ramified rings $R_m/R_0$. It is not hard to see that this actually works almost at the generic point of the special fibre: At the generic point, the local ring is a discrete valuation ring, and the statement is that the discriminant of the extension of discrete valuation rings becomes arbitrarily small as $m\\to\\infty$ (this boils down to some more or less classical ramification theory).\nNow, assume that you were lucky, and for some $m$, the ramification at the generic point of the special fibre is not just very close to zero, but actually zero on the nose. Zariski-Nagata purity tells you that the ramification locus of $S_m$ over $R_m$ has to be pure of codimension $1$, but you know that there is no ramification at the codimension $1$ points (which are either in characteristic $0$, or equal to the generic point of the special fibre) -- thus, there is no ramification at all, and $S_m$ over $R_m$ is etale.\nThe almost purity theorem says that this result extends to the almost world: In the limit as $m\\to \\infty$, $S_\\infty$ over $R_\\infty$ is almost etale (in the technical sense defined in almost ring theory).", "meta": {"post_id": 132438, "input_score": 39, "output_score": 44, "post_title": "Why is Faltings' \"almost purity theorem\" a purity theorem?"}}

I will show that there are only finitely many integer values polynomial $f(z)$ with $|f(n)| < (\\tau-\\epsilon)^n$.\nLet $f$ be such a polynomial of degree $d$. Set\n$$\\frac{p(z)}{(1-z)^{d+1}} = \\phi(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f(n) z^n$$\nThen $p(z)$ has integer coefficients, $p(1) \\neq 0$, and we can uniquely recover $f$ from $p$. Moreover, there is some $M$ and some $\\delta_1>0$ (dependent on $\\epsilon$) so that $|\\phi(z)| < M$ on $|z|=\\tau^{-1}+\\delta_1$.\nWe make the change of variables $u = 1/(1-z)$, so $z=1-1/u$. We have $\\phi(1-1/u) = p(1-1/u) u^{d+1}$. Set $q(u) = p(1-1/u) u^{d+1}$. From the properties of $p$ above, $q$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree $d+1$, and $|q(1/(1-z))| < M$ when $|z|=\\tau^{-1}+\\delta_1$. The map $z \\mapsto 1/(1-z)$ sends $|z|=\\tau^{-1}+\\delta_1$ to a circle which contains the circle of radius $1+\\delta_2$ around $\\tau$ (for some $\\delta_2>0$).  So, using the maximum modulus principle, $|q(u)|<M$ on  the circle of radius $1+\\delta_2$ around $\\tau$.\nWe therefore make one more change of coordinates, $v=u-\\tau$ and $s(v) = q(v+\\tau)$, to get a polynomial $s$ with $|s(v)|<M$ on the circle of radius $1+\\delta_2$ around $0$. Although $s$ does not have integer coefficients, its leading term $v^{d+1}$ is a nonzero integer.\nChoose $D_1$ sufficiently large enough that $2 \\pi M (1+\\delta_2)^{-D_1-1} <1$. Then, for $D_2 \\geq D_1$, taking a contour integral around $|v|=1+\\delta_2$ shows that the coefficient of $v^{D_2}$ in $s(v)$ has absolute value $<1$. Since the coefficient of $v^{d+1}$ is a nonzero integer, this establishes that $d<D_1$. So we have bounded the degree of $f$. Thus, $f$ is determined by its values at $D_1$ integers, and there are only finitely many possible polynomials $f$.\n\nNow for the reverse bound. This argument is closely based on the proof of Fekete's Theorem here. (The original paper is here, but I don't speak German so I haven't checked whether they are the same argument.)\nOur first goal is to establish the following: Let $r < 1$. There exists a nonzero polynomial $q(u)$ with integer coefficients so that $|q(u)|<1$ on the circle $|u-\\tau|<r$.\nChoose an integer $T$ large enough that, for any $N > T$, we have\n$$r^N + (1/2) r^{N-1} + (1/2) r^{N-2} + \\cdots + (1/2) r^{T+1} + (1/2) r^T < 1/3.$$\nTake $N$ larger than $T$. Define $q^N_N(u) = (u-\\tau)^N$. Define $q^N_i(u)$ to be the unique polynomial of the form\n$$q^N_i(u) = q^N_{i+1}(u) + \\theta_i \\cdot (u-\\tau)^{i}$$\nso that $|\\theta_i| \\leq 1/2$ and the coefficient of $u^{i}$ in $q^N_i$ is an integer. Set $q^N(u) = q^N_T(u)$. So the coefficient of $u^k$ in $q^N(u)$ is an integer for $T \\leq k \\leq N$.\nFor $u$ on the circle $|u-\\tau|=r$, we get\n$$|q^N_T(u)| \\leq r^N + (1/2) r^{N-1} + \\cdots + (1/2) r^T < 1/3.$$\nLet $(c^N_{T-1}, C^N_{T-2}, \\ldots, c^T_0)$ be the last $T$, noninteger, coefficients of $q^N$. By the Pigeonhole principle, we can find $q^M$ and $q^N$ so that\n$$\\sum_i |\\{ c^N_i - c^M_i \\}| r^i < 1/3$$\nwhere $\\{ x \\}$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. We define $q(u)$ to be the result of taking $q^N(u) - q^M(u)$ and rounding the last $T$ coefficients to the nearest integer. We have now constructed $q$.\nWe now undo the above argument. Since $|q(u)|<1$ for $|u-\\tau|<r$, we have $|q(1/(1-z))|<1$ on the disc with diameter $(1-(\\tau+r)^{-1}, 1-(\\tau-r)^{-1})$. This contains the circle of radius $\\tau^{-1} - \\delta_1$ about $0$, where $\\delta_1 \\to 0$ as $r \\to 1$. So Noam's argument constructs infinitely many polynomials bounded by $(\\tau+\\delta_2)^n$.\n\nJust for the fun of it, I used the above construction to find a polynomial $\\sum_{i=1}^{20} \\theta_i (u-\\tau)^i$ with $|\\theta_i| < 1/2$ and all coefficients\nother than the constant term integral.

{"input": "Yesterday I was shocked to discover that function extensionality (the statement that if two functions $f$ and $g$ on the same domain satisfy $f\\left(x\\right) = g\\left(x\\right)$ for all $x$ in the domain, then $f = g$) is not an axiom in the standard constructive logic of Coq. Of course, one can add it as an axiom in one's files, but it is not obviously available in any pre-defined tactics. I am left wondering...\n1. What is the thinking behind considering function extensionality as foreign to the calculus of constructions? I thought that from a computational perspective, a function really is there to be applied to things, and cannot carry any more information than what it does to them (and its type). For a moment I suspected that Coq avoids function extensionality in order to allow applying results to models like arbitrary enriched categories whose internal homomorphisms carry some more information than plain morphisms. But this is not the case: Coq (since version 8.4) has a implementation of eta-expansion (saying that any function $f$ equals the function sending every $x$ in its domain to $f\\left(x\\right)$, provided the types are right). In an enriched category, this would pour any additional structure of an internal Hom down the drain. (I must say the eta-expansion in Coq feels rather weird, too -- it is triggered by the reflexivity tactic. I expected it to be a tactic on its own...) Having eta-expansion but no extensionality is seriously confusing: one can have $f\\left(x\\right) = g\\left(x\\right)$ for all $x$, and yet one cannot rewrite the $f\\left(x\\right)$ in \"the function sending every $x$ to $f\\left(x\\right)$\" as a $g\\left(x\\right)$. And there I thought the bound variable in a lambda term would be like the bound variable in a forall quantification?\n2. On a more practical note (and more on-topic in MathOverflow), how much do the axiom of function extensionality and the (weaker) axiom of eta-expansion contribute to the strength of the logic? (At this point I have to admit that I don't really know the definition of the logic involved, so I'll just say I'm talking about the logic of Coq with no additional axioms assumed; it has so far been agreeing with my intuitive understanding of constructivism, until extensionality came along.) If I can define two terms $a$ and $b$ of type $\\mathrm{nat}$ (natural numbers) and use function extensionality (resp. eta-reduction, both ways) to prove their equality, can I also do it without? If I can prove a (more complicated) statement using function extensionality, is there a way to transform it into a (possibly clumsier) statement which can be proven without function extensionality and which can be transformed into the former statement using some straightforward applications of function extensionality?\nI'm sorry for logical naivety. The way I am posing the question, I fear it would qualify as soft; nevertheless I am pretty sure that there is some precise statements to be made here (or maybe just a reference to a textbook to be given).", "output": "I am going to draw heavily from Github discussion on HoTT book pull request 617.\nThere are different kinds of equality. Let us say that equality is \"intensional\" if it distinguishes objects based on how they are defined, and \"extensional\" if it distinguishes objects based on their \"extension\" or \"observable behavior\". In Frege's terminology, intensional equality compares sense and extensional equality compares reference.\nTo use Russell's example, intensionally the morning star and the evening star are clearly not the same (because their definitions are different), but they are extensionally the same because they both denote the same object (planet Venus). A more mathematical example is comparison of $x + y$ and $y + x$. These are extensionally equal, but intensionally differ because (the usual) definition of $+$ treats its arguments asymmetrically. It should be clear that two functions may be extensionally equal (have same behavior) even though they differ intensionally (have different definitions).\nIt is possible for two kinds of equality to coexist. Thus in type theory there are two equalities. The intensional one is called \"judgmental\" or \"definitional equality\" $\\equiv$ and the extensional one is known as \"propositional equality\" $=$. Mathematicians are aware of $=$ as a \"real thing\" while they think of $\\equiv$ as \"formal manipulation of symbolic expressions\" or some such.\nWe may control the two kinds of equality and the relationship between them with additional axioms. For instance, the reflection rule collapses $\\equiv$ and $=$ by allowing us to conclude $a \\equiv b$ from $a = b$ (the other direction is automatic). There are also varying degrees of extensionality of $=$. Without any extra axioms, $=$ is already somewhat extensional. For instance, we can prove commutativity of $+$ on natural numbers by induction in the form $x + y = y + x$, but we cannot prove $x + y \\equiv y + x$. Function extensionality is an axiom which describes what constitutes an \"observation\" on functions: by saying that two functions are equal when they give equal values we are in essence saying that only values matter (but not for example the \"running time\" or some other aspect of evaluation). Another axiom which makes $=$ \"more extensional\" is the Univalence axiom.\nIt is hard to do mathematics without function extensionality, but type theorists have their reasons for not including it as an axiom by default. But before I explain the reason, let me mention that there is a standard workaround. We may introduce user-defined equalities on types by equipping types with equivalence relations. This is what Bishop did in his constructive mathematics, and this is what we do in Coq when we use setoids. With such user-defined equalities we of course recover function extensionality by construction. However, setoids are often annoying to work with, and they drag in technical problems which we would prefer to avoid. Incidentally, the setoid model shows that function extensionality does not increase the power of type theory (it is a model validating function extensionality built in type theory without function extensionality).\nSo why don't type theorist adopt function extensionality? If we want to have a type theory with nice properties, and a useful proof assistant, then $\\equiv$ should be \"easy\" to deal with. Technically speaking, we would like a strongly normalizing $\\equiv$. By assuming function extensionality we throw into type theory a new constant funext without explaining how it interacts with the process of strong normalization, and things break. Type theorists would say that we failed to explain the computational meaning of funext.\nConsequently, Coq does not adopt function extensionality because that would lead to a lot of problems. Coq would not be able to handle $\\equiv$ automagically anymore, and the whole system would just have worse behavior. Type theorists of course recognize that having a good computational explanation of function extensionality, and more generally of the univalence problem, would be extremely desirable. This is why the HoTTest open problem is to give a computational interpretation of the univalence axiom. Once this is accomplished, we ought to have at our disposal type systems and proof assistants which are much more natural from a mathematician's point of view. Until then, you can always assume funext as an axiom and work around the resulting complications. To see how this can be done, have a loot at the Funext axiom in the HoTT library.\n[This P.S. is outdated after the question was edited.] P.S. The title of your question points to a common leap of reasoning from \"not accepting function extensionality\" to \"denying function extensionality\". While there are models in which function extensionality has counter-examples, one should be aware of the difference between \"not accept\" and \"deny\".

{"input": "Edit on March 2, 2018: I just noticed that this is almost identical to a question asked on MO by David Harden in 2011, and that I had even given an (incomplete) answer to that one.  I would delete the question, but I think this can't be done when an answer has been accepted ( I did try).\nThe title says it all really. I know that in some \"small\" simple groups such as ${\\rm PSL}(2,p)$ it is known that if the order is divisible by $60,$ then $A_{5}$ does occur as a subgroup ( this is because sufficient control of the character table is available to exhibit an involution and an element of order $3$ whose product has order $5$). However, at the moment, I don't see a general strategy for attacking this question ( or similar ones), though of course it seems likely that some use of the classification of finite simple groups would be needed.\nLater edit: It is a little late for motivation, and I did not realise it when I asked the question, but it seems to follow from the affirmative answer outlined by Derek Holt that a finite group $G$ is $5$-solvable (ie has all composition factors of order $5$ or of order prime to $5$) if and only if every subgroup of $G$ has a Hall $\\{2,5\\}$-subgroup.\nRecall that a Hall subgroup of $G$ is one whose order and index are relatively prime.\nHere is an outline of the difficult half of the proof: suppose then that every subgroup of $G$ has a Hall $\\{2,5\\}$-subgroup, but that $G$ is not $5$-solvable, and $G$ is chosen to be of minimal order subject to this. Note that every proper subgroup of $G$ is $5$-solvable. I claim that $G/F(G)$ is non-Abelian simple. For let $M$ be a maximal normal subgroup of $G$, and suppose that $M \\neq 1$. Let $p$ be a prime divisor of $|M|$ and let $P$ be a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $M$. Then $G = MN_{G}(P)$ by a Frattini argument. If $N_{G}(P) < G$ then it easily follows that both $M$ and $G/M$ are $5$-solvable, and then $G$ is, contrary to assumption. Hence $P \\lhd G$. Since $p$ as arbitrary, $M$ is nilpotent. Hence $M = F(G)$ is the unique maximal normal subgroup of $G$, and $G/M$ is non-Abelian simple. Now it easy to check that every subgroup of $G/M$ has a Hall $\\{2,5\\}$-subgroup, since $G$ has that property.\nNow, however, $G/M$ can't have order divisible by $60$, using the answer to this question (otherwise, it has a subgroup isomorphic to $A_{5}$, but $A_{5}$ has no subgroup of order $20$). However, $G/M$ must have order divisible by $5$, otherwise $G$ would be $5$-solvable. Also, by Feit-Thompson, $G/M$ has order divisible by $4$. Hence $G/M$ has order prime to $3$, so that $G/M$ is a Suzuki group. However, no simple Suzuki group has a Hall $\\{2,5\\}$-subgroup, a contradiction.", "output": "Let me make my comment into an answer just get things off the ground. I claim that ${\\rm PSL}(n,q)$ contains $A_5$ whenever its order is divisible by $60$.\nClearly ${\\rm SL}(n,q)$ contains ${\\rm SL}(m,q)$ for all $m \\le n$, and hence ${\\rm PSL}(n,q)$ contains some central quotient of ${\\rm SL}(m,q)$ (which is something between ${\\rm SL}(m,q)$ and ${\\rm PSL}(m,q)$). In particular, ${\\rm PSL}(n,q)$ contains a central quotient of ${\\rm SL}(5,q)$ for all $n \\ge 5$. Since the centre of ${\\rm SL}(5,q)$ has order $1$ or $5$, and $A_5$ has no perfect $5$-fold central extension, if ${\\rm PSL}(5,q)$ contains $A_5$, then so does ${\\rm SL}(5,q)$. Also $|{\\rm PSL}(5,q)|$ is divisible by $60$ for all $q$. So it suffices to prove the claim for $n \\le 5$.\nThe result is well-known for $n=2$. \nFor $n=3$, ${\\rm PSL}(3,q)$ contains ${\\rm PSL}(2,q)$ as the subgroup ${\\rm P}\\Omega(3,q)$, and $|{\\rm PSL}(3,q)|$ is divisible by $60$ if and only if $|{\\rm PSL}(2,q)|$ is, so the result holds.\nFor $n=4$, ${\\rm PSL}(4,q)$ contains the subgroup ${\\rm P}\\Omega^-(4,q) \\cong {\\rm PSL}(2,q^2)$ which has order divisible by $60$ for all $q$ and hence contains $A_5$.\nFor $n=5$, ${\\rm PSL}(5,q)$ contains $A_5$ as the image of the natural permutation representation.\nLet me carry on with the classical groups. This is not too hard.\nVirtually the identical argument works for the unitary groups. In dimensions $3$ and $4$ they contain the same orthogonal groups, and the permutation representation of $A_5$ clearly preserves the identity matrix as unitary form.\nFor the symplectic case, the obvious containment ${\\rm Sp}(m,q) \\le {\\rm Sp}(n,q)$ for $m \\le n$, $m,n$ even projects onto ${\\rm PSp}(m,q) \\le {\\rm PSp}(n,q)$, and ${\\rm PSp}(4,q)|$ is divisible by $60$ for all $q$, so it is enough to do it for $n=4$. From the ATLAS, the $4$-dimensional irreducible representation of ${\\rm SL}(2,5)$ has indicator $-$ and integer character values,  so its image reduces to a subgroup ${\\rm SL}(2,5) < {\\rm Sp}(4,q)$ for all $q = p^e$ with $p>5$. In fact it works also for $p=5$, and the cases ${\\rm PSp}(4,2) \\cong S_6$ and ${\\rm PSp}(4,3)$ (which contains $2^4:A_5$) can be done separately.\nFinally, all of the simple orthogonal groups in dimension at least $5$ contain ${\\rm P}\\Omega(5,q) \\cong {\\rm PSp}(4,q)$, so there is nothing new to do there.\nNow for some of the smaller rank exceptional groups. The Suzuki groups $^2B(q)$ have order not divisible by $3$. There are containments ${\\rm PSL}(2,q) < {\\rm SL}(3,q) < G_2(q) < {^3D}_4(q)$, and their orders are all either divisible by $60$ or not, so that covers them. Similarly ${\\rm PSL}(2,q) < {^2G}_2(q)$.\nThat leaves $F_4$, $^2F_4$, $E_6$ $^2E_6$, $E_7$ and $E_8$. For $^2F_4(2^{2n+1})$, I suspect that they all contain the smallest one in the class, the Tits group $^2F_4(2)'$, which (according to the ATLAS) contains $A_5$.\nThis is probably not the best reference, but I think Table 2 in\nhttp://seis.bristol.ac.uk/~tb13602/docs/large_4.pdf\nis enough to deal with the remaining exceptional groups. For example $F_4(q)$ contains $D_4(q)$ = $\\Omega^+(8,q)$, which contains ${\\rm P}\\Omega(5,q)$, which we considered above.

It was observed that $f_n$ has an elementary antiderivative for $n=0$, $1$, and $2$, and the problem was to determine whether $f_n$ has an elementary antiderivative for some $n>2$.\n\nI am going to show that there is no elementary antiderivative of $f_n$ when  $n>2$.\n\nAssume $n>2$ (NB: This is important, because the argument below will not work for $n\\le2$; the reader may enjoy finding where it breaks down), and let $K_n = {\\mathbb C}\\bigl(x,f_n(x)\\bigr)$ be the elementary differential field generated by $x$ and $f_n(x)$.  Then $K_n$ is the field of meromorphic functions on the normalization $\\hat C_n$ of the algebraic curve $C_n$ defined by the minimal degree $y$-monic polynomial $P_n(x,y)$ that satisfies $P_n\\bigl(x,f_n(x)\\bigr) \\equiv 0$.  This minimal degree is $2^n$; for example, $P_2(x,y) = (y^2-x)^2-x-1$ and $P_3(x,y) = \\bigl((y^2-x)^2-x\\bigr)^2-x-1$, etc.\n\nSince $P_{n+1}(x,y) = (P_n(x,y)+1)^2-x-1$ for $n\\ge 1$ with $P_1(x,y)=y^2-x-1$, one sees, by applying the Eisenstein Criterion to $P_n(x,y)$ regarded as an element of $D[y]$ with $D$ being the integral domain ${\\mathbb C}[x]$, that $P_n(x,y)$ is irreducible for all $n\\ge 1$.  Hence, $\\hat C_n$ is connected. \n\nIt will be important in what follows to observe that $K_n$ has an involution $\\iota$ that fixes $x$ and sends $f_n(x)$ to $-f_n(x)$; this is because $P_n(x,y)$ is an even polynomial in $y$.  The fixed field of $\\iota$ is ${\\mathbb C}\\bigl(x,\\,f_n(x)^2\\bigr)$, and the $(-1)$-eigenspace of $\\iota$ is ${\\mathbb C}\\bigl(x,\\,f_n(x)^2\\bigr)f_n(x) = K_{n-1}{\\cdot}f_n(x)$.\n\nNow, the curve $C_n\\subset \\mathbb{CP}^2$ has only one point on the line at infinity, namely $[1,0,0]$, but the normalization $\\hat C_n$ has $2^{n-1}$ points lying over this point.  They can be parametrized as follows:  First, establish the convention that $\\sqrt{u}$ means the unique analytic function on the complex $u$-plane minus its negative axis and $0$ that satisfies $\\sqrt1 = 1$ and $\\bigl(\\sqrt{u}\\bigr)^2 = u$.  Let $\\epsilon = (\\epsilon_1,\\ldots,\\epsilon_{n-1})$ be any sequence with ${\\epsilon_k}^2=1$ and consider the sequence of functions $g^\\epsilon_k(t)$ defined by the criteria $g^\\epsilon_1(t) = \\sqrt{1+t^2}$ and $g^\\epsilon_{k+1}(t) = \\sqrt{1+\\epsilon_{n-k}t g^\\epsilon_k(t)}$ for $1\\le k < n$.  Choose, as one may, a $\\delta_n>0$ sufficiently small so that, when $t$ is complex and satisfies $|t|<\\delta_n$, all of the functions $g^\\epsilon_k$ are analytic when $|t|<\\delta_n$.  In particular, one finds an expansion\n$$\ng^\\epsilon_n(t) \n= 1+\\tfrac12\\epsilon_1\\,t + \\tfrac18(2\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2-1)t^2 + O(t^3).\n$$\n\nAlso, it is easy to verify that the disk in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ defined by\n$$\n[x,y,1] = [1,\\ t g^\\epsilon_n(t),\\ t^2]\\qquad\\text{for}\\quad |t|<\\delta_n\n$$\nis a nonsingular parametrization of a branch of $C_n$ in a neighborhood of the point $[1,0,0]$.  In the normalization $\\hat C_n$, this is then a local parametrization of a neighborhood of a point $p_\\epsilon\\in \\hat C_n$.\nObviously, this describes $2^{n-1}$ distinct points on $\\hat C_n$. \n\nWhen $x$ and $f_n$ are regarded as meromorphic functions on $\\hat C_n$, \nit follows that there is a unique local coordinate chart $t_\\epsilon:D_\\epsilon\\to D(0,\\delta_n)\\subset \\mathbb{C}$ of an open disk $D_\\epsilon\\subset \\hat C_n$ about $p_\\epsilon$ such that $t_\\epsilon(p_\\epsilon)=0$ and on which one\nhas formulae\n$$\nx = \\frac1{{t_\\epsilon}^2}\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\nf_n(x) = \\frac{g^\\epsilon_n(t_\\epsilon)}{t_\\epsilon} \n= \\frac{1+\\tfrac12\\epsilon_1\\ t_\\epsilon \n         +\\tfrac18(2\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2-1)\\ {t_\\epsilon}^2}\n   {t_\\epsilon} \n+ O({t_\\epsilon}^2).\n$$ \nIn particular, it follows that $f_n(x)$, as a meromorphic function on $\\hat C_n$,\nhas polar divisor equal to the sum of the $p_\\epsilon$ and hence has degree $2^{n-1}$. Of course, this implies that the zero divisor of $f_n(x)$ on $\\hat C_n$ must be of degree $2^{n-1}$ as well. \n\nNote that the functions $g^\\epsilon_k$ satisfy $g^{-\\epsilon}_k(-t) = g^{\\epsilon}_k(t)$, where $-\\epsilon = (-\\epsilon_1,\\ldots,-\\epsilon_{n-1})$.\nThis implies that $\\iota(p_\\epsilon) = p_{-\\epsilon}$ and that\n$t_\\epsilon\\circ\\iota = -t_{-\\epsilon}$.\n\nNow, the $2^{n-1}$ zeroes of $f_n(x)$ on $\\hat C_n$ are distinct, for they are the zeros of the polynomial $q_n(x) = P_n(x,0) = (q_{n-1}+1)^2-x-1$, and the discriminant of $q_n$, being the resultant of $q_n$ and $q_n'$, is clearly an odd integer, and hence is not zero.  Thus, $C_n$ is a branched double cover of $C_{n-1}$, branched exactly where $f_{n}$ has its zeros. This induces a branched cover $\\pi_n:\\hat C_n\\to \\hat C_{n-1}$ that is exactly the quotient of $\\hat C_n$ by the involution $\\iota$ (whose fixed points are where $f_n$ has its zeros).  Since one then has the Riemann-Hurwitz formula\n$$\n\\chi(\\hat C_n) = 2\\chi(\\hat C_{n-1}) - B_n = 2\\chi(\\hat C_{n-1}) - 2^{n-1},\n$$\nand $\\chi(\\hat C_1) = \\chi(\\hat C_2) = 2$, induction gives $\\chi(\\hat C_n) = \n(3{-}n)2^{n-1}$, so the genus of $\\hat C_n$ is $(n{-}3) 2^{n-2} + 1$.  (This won't actually be needed below, but it is interesting.)\n\nThe only poles of $x$ and $f_n(x)$ on $\\hat C_n$ are the points $p_\\epsilon$, \nand computation using the above expansions shows that, \nin a neighborhood of $p_\\epsilon$, one has an expansion of the form\n$$\nf_n(x)\\,\\mathrm{d} x \n- \\mathrm{d}\\left(f_n(x)\\bigl(\\tfrac12\\ x + \\tfrac16\\ f_n(x)^2\\bigr) \\right)\n= \\left(\\frac{ (1-\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2) }\n         {4{t_\\epsilon}^2}\n          + O({t_\\epsilon}^{-1})\\right)\\ \\mathrm{d} t_\\epsilon\\ .\n$$\nThus, the meromorphic differential $\\eta$ on $\\hat C_n$ \ndefined by the left hand side of this equation has, at worst, double poles \nat the points $p_\\epsilon$ and no other poles.\n\nNow, by Liouville's Theorem, $f_n$ has an elementary antiderivative if and only if $f_n(x)\\ \\mathrm{d} x$ and, hence, the form $\\eta$ are expressible as finite linear combinations of exact differentials and log-exact differentials.\nThus, $f_n(x)$ has an elementary antiderivative if and only if $\\eta$ is expressible in the form\n$$\n\\eta = \\mathrm{d} h + \\sum_{i=1}^m c_i\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d} g_i}{g_i}\n$$\nfor some $h,g_1,\\cdots g_m\\in K_n$ and some constants $c_1,\\ldots,c_m$.  Suppose that these exist.  Since $\\eta$ has, at worst, double poles at the $p_\\epsilon$ and no other poles, it follows that $h$ must have, at worst, simple poles at the points $p_\\epsilon$ and no other poles; in fact, $h$ is uniquely determined up to an additive constant because its expansion at $p_\\epsilon$ in terms of $t_\\epsilon$ must be of the form\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2-1}{4t_\\epsilon} + O(1).\n$$\nMoreover, because $\\eta$ is odd with respect to $\\iota$, it follows that $h$ (after adding a suitable constant if necessary) must also be odd with respect to $\\iota$.  This implies, in particular, that $h$ vanishes at each of the zeros of $f_n$ (which, by the argument above, are simple zeros).  This implies that $h = r\\,f_n$ for some $r\\in K_{n-1}$ that has no poles and satisfies $r(p_\\epsilon) = (\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2-1)/4$ for each $\\epsilon$.  However, since $r$ has no poles and $\\hat C_n$ is connected, it follows that $r$ is constant.  Thus, it cannot take the two distinct values $0$ and $-1/2$, as the equation $r(p_\\epsilon) = (\\epsilon_1\\epsilon_2-1)/4$ implies.\n\nThus, the desired $h$ does not exist, and $f_n$ cannot be integrated in elementary terms for any $n>2$.", "meta": {"post_id": 171733, "input_score": 89, "output_score": 106, "post_title": "Is it possible to express $\\int\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+\\sqrt{x+1}}}dx$ in elementary functions?"}}

{"input": "In their 2001 paper defining periods, Kontsevich and Zagier (pdf) without further comment state that $e$ is conjecturally not a period while many other numbers showing up naturally (conjecturally) are. The former claim is repeated at many other internet sources including Wikipedia but nowhere could I find a heuristic making the conjecture that $e$ is not a period more plausible than its negation. Does anyone here know of such an argument?\n\nEDIT: I figured it would be good measure (i.e. 'shows research effort') to write what was the best I could come up with myself. I don't find it very convincing however so feel free to ignore. The number $e$ is more or less defined as the value at a rational number (1) of a function that is a solution to a ordinary differential equation ($y' = y$) with rational boundary condition ($y(0) = 1$). Now K & Z point out that all periods arise in this way (replace a rational number in the defining integral with a parameter and it will satisfy an ODE). However they also warn us that the differential equations are really special and (conjecturally) satisfy a lot of criteria among which having at most regular singularities.\nNow the singularity at infinity of $y'= y$ is not regular as it has order 2 (while the equation is of order 1) but of course this proves nothing since nothing is stopping $e$ from being the value at some rational number of a solution to a much more complicated differential equation which might be of the right class. So what is missing from an argument along these lines is some way of making precise that $y'= y$ really is the simplest equation which produces $e$ and that 'therefore' more complicated equations can be 'reduced' to it by a series of simplifications innocent enough to preserve the regularity of the singularities if it exists (quod non). Now personally I would not buy such a claim if it wasn't for the fact that it is a bit akin to conjecture 1 from K & Z.

The number $e$ is an example of an exponential period.

Story of Hilbert's Infinite Hotel, by Helge Kragh (2014)\n\nWhat is known as \"Hilbert's hotel\" is a story of an imaginary hotel\nwith infinitely many rooms that illustrates the bizarre consequences\nof assuming an actual infinity of objects or events. Since the 1970s\nit has been used in a variety of arguments, some of them relating to\ncosmology and others to philosophy and theology. For a long time it\nhas remained unknown whether David Hilbert actually proposed the\nthought experiment named after him, or whether it was merely a piece\nof mathematical folklore. It turns out that Hilbert introduced his\nhotel in a lecture of January 1924, but without publishing it. The\ncounter-intuitive hotel only became better known in 1947, when George\nGamow described it in a book, and it took nearly three more decades\nuntil it attracted wide interest in scientific, philosophical, and\ntheological contexts. The paper outlines the origin and early history\nof Hilbert's hotel paradox. At the same time it retracts the author's\nearlier conclusion that the paradox was originally due to Gamow.\n\nThe relevant quote from Hilbert's 1924 lecture is as follows (my translation from German):\n\nAn application of this fact is provided by the hotel manager, who has\na hotel with a finite number of rooms. All these rooms are occupied by\nguests. When the guests exchange their room in any way, so that again\nno room has more than one guest, then that will not free a room, and\nthe hotel manager cannot in this way make space for a newly arrived\nguest. We can also say: A part of a finite quantity is never equal in\nnumber to the whole. [...]\nHow is this for an infinite quantity? Let us take as the simplest\nexample the quantity of integer numbers. Here already this law \"a part\nis smaller than the whole\" no longer holds. We can explain this\nimportant fact easily using our example of the occupied hotel. This\ntime we assume that the hotel has infinitely many numbered rooms,\n$1,2,3,4,5,\\ldots$, in each of which there lives a guest. When a new guest\narrives, all the manager has to do is to allow each of the old guests\nto occupy the room having one number higher, and this will free room\nnumber 1 for the new arrival. Of course, in this way space can be made\nfor any finite number of new guests, and in this world of an infinite\nnumber of houses and occupants there will be no housing shortage. [...]\nIndeed, it is even possible to make space for an infinite number of new guests.\nFor example, each of the old guests, originally occupying room number $n$,\njust has to move to number $2n$.

When I had a class in the index theorem, our proof basically showed Gauss-Bonnet is a special case of Atiyah-Singer using an appropriate Dirac operator.

This turns out to be a difficult question: specifically, the statement that for every reasonable theory $T$, there exists a reasonable theory $S$ such that $T$ does not have polynomial-size proofs of $\\mathrm{Con}(S,n)$, is equivalent to the nonexistence of optimal propositional proof systems, which is closely related to various problems in computational complexity.\nReference\n[1] Pavel Pudl\u00e1k: On the length of proofs of finitistic consistency statements in first order theories, in: Logic Colloquium \u201984 (J.

{"input": "Since there will be a long digression in a moment, let me start by reassuring you that my intention really is to ask the question in the title.\nRecently, there has been a flurry of new discussion surrounding Shinichi Mochizuki's interuniversal Teichmueller theory (IUTT). I've been personally quite ashamed about the state of affairs. Regardless of the eventual correctness of the paper in all detail, this is an earnest attempt by an esteemed colleague to present a serious vision of mathematics. Not to have given it proper attention for so long reflects poor manners on my part, to say the least. After an  initial attempt to organise a workshop, I've essentially let things slide, assuming things would get sorted out somehow. Clearly, it hasn't happened until now. Some dedicated young people have been reading the papers (for example, I've had a number of illuminating exchanges with Chung Pang Mok recently), but my impression is that they also need some support. Some might ask why I, for example, don't just read the papers carefully myself. Well, as you know, for most people chugging along amid the cares of everyday life, it's quite painful to read long difficult papers without the aid of human discussion and interaction. Mochizuki, by the way, is one of those  rare people  gifted with the incredible powers of concentration and stamina necessary to   sit and do mathematics for long periods in solitude. This was true ever since he was a young student. Perhaps this is a key reason he can't understand why the rest of us are so reluctant. Anyway, I'm moving towards suggesting another workshop in the near future. However, to increase the chance that good mathematicians will participate, it seems sensible to disseminate some more background material on the relevant mathematical structures.\nMy plan is to do this in a series of questions on MO. How many there will be, I don't have a clear sense of at the moment. Of course, I have myself  just a vague general idea of the notions in the IUTT papers, and even what I knew two years ago, I've forgotten. So my plan is to outline something, quite possibly incorrect and certainly incomplete, and then invite others to improve on my exposition. It's my hope that the people who have read the papers much more carefully will contribute and that some new readers will be motivated. For some time, I've been deeply impressed by the energy and integrity of the community surrounding  this site. It seems quite appropriate as a venue for unraveling some of the mystery surrounding IUTT.\nTo read the IUTT papers, a new concept we need to understand well is that of a Frobenioid. To explain why, let me remind you that the main object of study in IUTT is the log-theta lattice associated to an elliptic curve over a number field. The  name refers to a collection of oriented paths (Panoramic Overview, Figure 3.1) going between points arranged like a two-dimensional lattice, which represent  copies of a $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}NF$-Hodge theatre. It might be worth emphasising that once you understand this lattice, most of the conceptual background is in place. The extent to which completely new structures are supposed to be endlessly multiplied in these papers has, in my opinion, been greatly exaggerated. \nWhat kind of a thing is a $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}NF$-Hodge theatre? It is a category,  itself glued out of two other categories, a $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}$-Hodge theatre and a $\\Theta NF$-Hodge theatre, but for now, we will deemphasise this particular decomposition. (Once again, in case you're worried, there are no other kinds of Hodge theatres.)\nBut in view of the apparently complicated structure whose details might require some guiding principle to grasp, it is reasonable to ask about the main goal, that is, what exactly the point might be of  a $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}NF$-Hodge theatre. Well, as is stated in a variety of ways by Mochizuki himself, it is supposed to be a categorical model of the spectrum of an algebraic number field $F$, together with some extra structure of a crystalline nature. In some sense, it's  the same kind of combinatorial encoding of $F$ as the category of finite \u00e9tale $F$-algebras, or an `abstract combinatorialization of scheme-theoretic arithmetic geometry.'  If you are not used to this  point of view, you should try to visualise  a category as something like a one-dimensional abstract simplicial complex where even quite complicated objects are reduced to points and their structure encoded in a network of arrows. In the present context, this can be a bit confusing because the Hodge theatres are represented as points connected by paths in the log-theta lattice, but when observed closely, they also resolve into a network.\nThe 'crystalline nature' of the extra structure is used in a very vague sense.\nIt's just an elliptic curve over the number field, which determines a set of so-called `theta data'. On the one hand, this extra structure is there because we're interested in Szpiro's conjecture (=ABC conjecture). However, a far more essential goal  of the theory is to deform the number field in a canonical fashion, in a manner analogous to lifting a curve  over a perfect field of positive characteristic  to characteristic zero. There as well, one normally doesn't have a canonical lift. However, the $p$-adic Teichmueller theory was developed exactly to deal with this difficulty: If you equip the curve with an ordinary nilpotent indigenous bundle, which exists for a generic curve, then there is a canonical lift. Because these kinds of indigenous bundles are finite in number, one might say that the curve itself has been canonically lifted up to finite indeterminacy. (Even naively, this is much better than the uncountably infinite indeterminacy associated with choosing any lift.)  There is by now a long tradition of crystalline philosophy, whereby an object that doesn't itself admit a canonical deformation acquires one through the addition of some natural extra structure. The simplest example of this phenomenon is the structure of a crystal on the universal extension of an abelian variety. The elliptic curve and the attendant theta data are supposed to be exactly this kind of extra structure that allows us to deform the field in a canonical fashion. That is to say, from a certain point of view, it's really the field that's of interest, and the elliptic curve is just auxiliary structure one has to incorporate in order to arrive at a crystal-like situation.\nIn fact, the log-theta lattice is itself  the deformation.  At the risk of boring you with repetition, I will restate that a log-theta lattice is made out of  copies of a single $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}NF$-Hodge theatre, which, in turn, is a categorical model of a number field together with a     crystalline structure. If you would like to see why a deformation might be made out of the object that it tries to deform, the simplest example to consider is the way in which  $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is made out of copies of  $\\mathbb{F}_p$, especially when considered as the ring of Witt vectors.\nPerhaps a more elementary remark is that many reasonable deformations in geometry are fibre bundles over the deformation space, so that all fibres are   somewhat the same (with varying degrees of rigidity depending on the situation) as the central fibre that we started out with.  With the Hodge theatres, Mochizuki's analogy is that they all have the same real-analytic structure, while the holomorphic structure varies.\nBefore getting to the main point, let me say a word about `glueing'.\nNow, there may be other notions involved, but one basic one is that of grafting,\nIf $A$ and $B$ are categories equipped with functors $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ to $C$, then we define the (directed) graft\n$$A\\vdash_C B$$\n by taking the union of $Ob(A)$ and $Ob(B)$, then simply defining new morphisms from an object $a$ of $A$ to an object $b$ of $B$  as morphisms $\\phi(a)\\rightarrow \\psi(b)$.   This construction is quite simple, and  I am very far from understanding the different ways of gluing the categories that occur in IUTT, so  more on this later. \nFor the moment, I wish to concentrate just a little bit on the internal structure of a $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}NF$-Hodge theatre, leaving aside for now the nature of the paths connecting the copies.  A $\\Theta^{\\pm ell}NF$-Hodge theatre is also glued in various way out of smaller categories, and this brings us to back to our title. The basic building blocks of everything in sight are categories called Frobenioids. Among the prerequisites for studying IUTT, this notion is the really new one. My feeling is that getting a concrete grip on it will already take us a good way towards understanding the whole picture. The other papers on absolute anabelian geometry and so forth are also hard, but still belong to more or less familiar sorts of anabelian geometry, since many people will have heard of  the Neukirch-Uchida theorem or Grothendieck's conjectures. (However, the main focus of the absolute anabelian geometry papers is to prove such reconstruction theorems algorithmically. We will return to this as well in a later question.)\nThe first question in this series is then \nWhat is a Frobenioid?\nIn the usual spirit of Mathoverflow,  I will set up some rudimentary language, give a few examples to show that I'm a serious participant, and wait for contributions from people with more expertise. \nI start with a quote from Mochizuki, which we can hope to understand better as more contributions come in:\na Frobenioid may be thought of as a sort of a category-theoretic abstraction of the theory of divisors and line bundles on models of finite separable extensions of a given function field or number field.\nThe simplest Frobenioid  is constructed out of a commutative monoid $M$ (satisfying some natural condition of being divisorial). One can then form a semi-direct product with $\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$, the multiplicative monoid of positive integers:\n$$\\mathbb{F}_M:=M\\ltimes \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1},$$\nwhich is a non-commutative monoid with composition defined by\n$$(a,n)(b,m)=(a+nb, nm).$$\nFor example, $M$ might be a monoid of effective Cartier divisors on a normal variety $B$ (or line bundles equipped with sections). The $\\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$-action encodes the tensor power operation on line bundles, which is simply absorbed  into the structure of $\\mathbb{F}_M$. In positive characteristic, the Frobenius map induces the $p$-th tensor power map on line bundles, and this monoid structure enables the construction of a substitute of sorts. Note also that we can regard a monoid as a category with a single object. \nThe next case starts with a family of monoids. By this, we mean a contravariant functor\n$$\\phi: \\mathcal{D}\\rightarrow Mon$$\nfrom some category $\\mathcal{D}$ to the category of commutative (divisorial) monoids. This $\\mathcal{D}$ notation seems to occur rather often and consistently throughout many papers as an indexing category (called a base category in the papers) for some family of monoids. The key example to keep in mind is where $\\mathcal{D}$ is a category of finite separable geometrically integral normal covers $X\\rightarrow B$ of a normal variety $B$, that is, the usual kind of category of Galois type that occurs in anabelian geometry. In that case, we can take $\\phi(X)$  to be a suitable family of effective $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier divisors on $X$. For example, they might be divisors that lie over a specific monoid of divisors on $B$, say generated by a specific set of prime divisors. (I am going to ignore here the subtleties surrounding pull-backs and types of singularities.)\nThe earlier semi-direct product construction can now be applied \nto the functor $\\phi$. The objects of $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$\n are just the objects of $\\mathcal{D}$ (as an extension of considering a monoid a category with a single object) but a  morphism\n$$ X\\rightarrow Y$$\nis a triple\n$$(f, S , n),$$\nwhere $f:X \\rightarrow Y $ is a morphism in $\\mathcal{D}$, $S\\in \\phi(X)$, and $n\\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$.\nIf $Y\\rightarrow Z$ is given by the triple $(g, T, m)$, then the composition\nis defined by\n$$(g, T, m)(f, S, n)=  (g\\circ f, f^*(S)+mT, mn).$$\nUp to here is pretty elementary. But some confusion may arise from the fact that the general Frobenioid involves yet another  category $\\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a functor $ \\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$. In fact, $\\mathcal{C}$ is in many ways more fundamental than $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$ and should be thought of as a fiber bundle over the base $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$, as $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$ is fibered over $\\mathcal{D}$. That is, we have a composition of fibrations\n$$\\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}\\rightarrow \\mathcal{D}.$$\nThe nature of $\\mathcal{C}$ is clarified by the main example, whereby $\\mathcal{C}$ is associated to  multiplicative groups of rational functions on varieties. The abstract framework for this example, is that of a model Frobenioid, which one constructs out of yet another functor\n$\\psi: \\mathcal{D}\\rightarrow Ab$ to abelian groups together with a map of functors\n$$Div:\\psi \\rightarrow \\phi^{gp},$$\nwhere $\\phi^{gp}$ denotes the group completion of $\\phi$ in an obvious sense.\n(As the notation suggests, the example to keep in mind is the homomorphism from rational functions to divisors.)\nOut of this data, we  form the category\n$\\mathcal{C}$ whose objects are pairs\n$$(X, \\alpha),$$ with $X$  an object of $\\mathcal{D}$ and $\\alpha\\in \\phi(X)^{gp}$.  A map from\n$(X, \\alpha)$ to $(Y, \\beta)$ is then a quadruple\n$$(f, S, n, u)$$\nwhere $f: X\\rightarrow Y$ is a morphism in $\\mathcal{D}$, $I\\in \\phi(X)$,  $n \\in \\mathbb{N}_{\\geq 1}$, $u\\in \\psi(X)$, and\n$$n\\alpha+S=f^*(\\beta)+Div(u).$$ We have merely added the components $\\alpha$ to the objects and the components $u$ to the morphisms. There is thus an obvious projection functor to $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$. The number $n$, by the way, is referred to as the Frobenius degree of the morphism, and seems to be eventually very important.\nFor the geometric $\\phi$ above, we can take $\\psi(X)\\subset K(X)^*$, a subgroup of the multiplicative group of  rational functions on $X$ whose supports are controlled by the divisors in $\\phi(X)$. If we view the monoids themselves as being morphisms, this formalism would suggest that $u$ is kind of a 2-morphism, and that $\\mathcal{C}$ might  better be described as a 2-category in some way. Anyway, I hope you'll agree at this point that the constructions really are not overly exotic.\nIt's worth working out the morphisms for which all components but one are trivial. We will denote the domain of a morphism by $(X, \\alpha)$ and the codomain by $(Y,\\beta)$.\n--A morphism of the form $(f, 0, 1,1)$, where $f:X\\rightarrow Y$ is a morphism of $\\mathcal{D}$.\nFor it to map $(X,\\alpha)$ to $(Y,\\beta)$, we must have $\\alpha=f^*\\beta$. We might, for example, choose a divisor $\\gamma$ on the base $B$,and let  $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ be pullbacks of $\\gamma$. This determines a faithful embedding of $\\mathcal{D}$ into $\\mathcal{C}$.\n--Now consider a morphism  of the form $(Id_X, S, 1, 1)$. Of course we must have $Y=X$ and $\\alpha+S=\\beta$. Thus, this is the `tensor product map' from $(X,\\alpha)$ to $(X, \\alpha+S)$.\n--A morphism of the form $(Id_X, 0, n, 1)$ from\n$(X,\\alpha)$ to $(X,\\beta)$ imposes\n$n\\alpha=\\beta$. So we have formally adjoined a map from a line bundle to its $n$-th tensor power. \n--$(Id_X, 0, 1, u)$ goes from $(X,\\alpha)$ to $(X,\\beta)$ such that $\\alpha=\\beta+Div(u)$.\nThis is a map of line bundles  in the usual sense.\nObviously, the intention is that as these morphisms intertwine, something interesting will happen.\nHopefully, we will soon see more precise clarifications of my approximate account. But the astute reader will already have noticed something not quite right. Earlier on, it was stated that a Frobenioid is a category, whereas we have indicated that it is a category $\\mathcal{C}$ equipped with a functor $\\mathcal{C}\\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$ for some family of monoids $\\phi.$ That some conceptual ambiguity is all right is essentially the main theorem of the first Frobenioid paper: In  all natural cases, the category $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$ and the functor to it are canonically determined by the category $\\mathcal{C}$. Thus, it is safe to refer to $\\mathcal{C}$ itself as the Frobenioid. Certainly, in the geometric example above, it's clear that $\\mathcal{C}$ contains the information for $\\mathbb{F}_{\\phi}$. But the point of the theorem is that with certain rigid assumptions,  this encoding can be detected purely category-theoretically. \nThere are a number of other  theorems of intrinsic interest about categoricity. For example, the base-category $\\mathcal{D}$ can be recovered from $\\mathcal{C}$. (What conditions are exactly necessary for this, I'm not able to say at the moment.) If $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\\mathcal{C}_2$ are Frobenioids and $E: \\mathcal{C}_1\\simeq \\mathcal{C}_2$, then $E$ must preserve the Frobenius degrees of morphisms. \nI think this is all I wish to say for now.\nAllow me to stress again that I still don't know what a Frobenioid really is and eagerly await corrections and elaborations. There are clearly numerous subtleties and points of emphasis that I am missing. In particular, if someone could  give a good account  of the main theorem alluded to above, I would be very grateful. I suspect that there are consequences of a rather concrete nature that we can appreciate within the realm of usual arithmetic geometry. This, of course, is the kind of thing that will convince a greater number of people to invest time in understanding the various papers. However, I hope even these superficial paragraphs will provide some indication that the kind of mathematical language developed by Mochizuki is interesting and natural. Indeed, to my untrained mind, the geometric Frobenioids appear very much to be in the spirit of $p$-adic Hodge theory, being subtle composites of structures of \u00e9tale and De Rham type. Since the earlier Hodge-Arakelov  papers had started with the intention of developing a global $p$-adic Hodge theory, maybe this association is not too far from correct.", "output": "About two years ago, I spent the better part of a month trying to get to the bottom of this question: What is a Frobenioid? After all, the IUTer's are fond of insisting that it's incumbent upon other mathematicians to invest time in understanding the foundations of IUT simply because Mochizuki's claimed theorems are, if true, so remarkable. I'm not a number theorist, so I had little hope of understanding the main body of IUT, but the foundational material on Frobenioids is pure category theory, so why not give that part a go?\nI came away feeling that my time spent on this project was wasted, for several reasons:\n\nIt was around the same time that Scholze and Stix met with Mochizuki. Apparently they were able to agree from the outset of their discussions that the whole apparatus of Frobenioids was unneccessary for understanding IUT. In this light, the insistence of the IUT camp that one can only understand the theory by plowing through the foundational papers from the bottom up (dubious as it may ever have seemed) is downright insulting. Essentially, I was promised mathematical insight for reading Mochizuki's papers and then told that I was a sucker for taking this promise at face value.\n\nThe definitions found in Mochizuki's Geometry of Frobenioids I, II are byzantine. My opinion by the end of the project (echoing suggestions that other category theorists had already made publicly) was that the whole apparatus, with a few minor tweaks, could be much more cleanly expressed, with much less need for ad hoc terminology, by using basic properties of the language of Grothendieck fibrations. Once re-expressed this way, the definitions appear clearly to consist of a somewhat-reasonable core, encrusted with numerous ad hoc extra conditions. I find it bewildering that Mochizuki did not care to use this clarifying language when writing these papers -- are not Grothendieck fibrations standard fare for anybody who is familiar with the material of SGA?\n\nIt might be argued that Mochizuki's definitions as stated are \"more correct\" than the tweaked versions I ended up formulating for theoretical reasons to do with how they are used in IUT. But my distinct impression is that this is not the case. To the extent that Frobenioids are used at all (and as discussed above, their use at all is apparently inessential), it is only certain well-behaved Frobenioids which are ever invoked, and these fall squarely within the parameters of the tweaked definitions I ended up using.\n\nThe avoidance of fibrational language is not only obuscatory, but downright harmful. In the course of this project, I found a counterexample to Proposition 4.4.ii in The Geometry of Frobenioids I, while also finding an amended statement of the theorem which is in fact true. I wrote to Mochizuki about it, and he kindly took my objection seriously. However, his response was to add a note to one of his many online manuscripts detailing errors in his work which corrected the statement, without engaging in a serious way with the material. In fact, I assert that the claimed theorem, in amended form, takes more work to prove than appears in the paper or the errata.\n\n\nAnyway, here's what a Frobenioid is, in slightly tweaked form:\nDefinition:\n\nA commutative monoid $\\Phi$ is said to be divisorial if $\\Phi$ is cancellative (i.e. $x+y = x+z \\Rightarrow y = z$), group-free (i.e. $M$ contains no nonzero invertible elements), and saturated (i.e. $M$ is closed under division in its group completion $\\Phi^{gp}$).\n\nIf $\\Phi$ is a commutative monoid, let $\\Phi \\rtimes \\mathbb N_{\\geq 1}$ denote the semidirect product of $\\Phi$ with the multiplicative monoid of positive integers, with respect to its canonical action.\n\nIf $\\mathcal D$ is a category, then a divisorial monoid in $\\mathcal D$ is defined to be a functor $\\Phi: \\mathcal D^{op} \\to \\mathsf{CMon}$, where $\\mathsf{CMon}$ is the category of commutative monoids) taking values in divisorial monoids. [1]\n\nIf $\\Phi: \\mathcal{D}^{op} \\to \\mathsf{CMon}$ is a divisorial monoid in $\\mathcal D$, then the elementary Frobenioid associated to $\\Phi$ is the Grothendieck fibration $\\mathbb F_\\Phi \\to \\mathcal D$ associated to the functor $\\Phi \\rtimes \\mathbb N_{\\geq 1}: \\mathcal D^{op}\\to \\mathsf{Mon}$ (where $\\mathsf{Mon}$ is the category of monoids, regarded as 1-object categories).[2]\n\nIf $\\Phi: \\mathcal D^{op} \\to \\mathsf{CMon}$ is a divisorial monoid in $\\mathcal D$, with group completion $\\Phi^{gp}$, and if $0 \\to \\Phi^{birat} \\to \\Phi^{gp} \\to Pic \\to 0$ is a short exact sequence of prehseaves of groups, then there is an action of the presheaf of monoids $\\Phi \\rtimes \\mathbb N_{\\geq 1}$ on $Pic$. The presheaf of transport categories for this action has a Grothendieck construction denoted $\\mathbb U_\\Phi \\to \\mathcal D$, with canonical map to $\\mathbb F_\\Phi \\to \\mathcal D$. This data is called the skeletal Frobenioid of unit-trivial type associated to $(\\mathcal D, \\Phi, \\Phi^{birat})$. Note that the map $\\mathbb U_\\Phi \\to \\mathbb F_\\Phi$ is a Grothendieck opfibration fibered over $\\mathcal D$.\n\nA skeletal pseudo Frobenioid of isotropic type consists of a series of functors $\\mathcal C \\to \\mathbb U_\\Phi \\to \\mathbb F_\\Phi \\to \\mathcal D$ such that $\\mathbb U_\\Phi \\to \\mathbb F_\\Phi \\to \\mathcal D$ is a skeletal Frobeniod of unit-trivial type, and additionally $\\mathcal C \\to \\mathcal D$ is a Grothendieck fibration, and $\\mathcal C \\to \\mathbb U_\\Phi$ is a Grothndieck opfibration fibered over $\\mathcal D$, fibered in groups, such that reindexing along a monoid element $Z \\in \\Phi(S)$ is always a group isomorphism.\n\nA model Frobenioid is one arising via a similar construction to the construction of $\\mathbb U_\\Phi$ using only a right-exact sequence $B \\to \\Phi^{gp} \\to Pic \\to 0$ of presheaves of abelian groups, where we set $\\Phi^{birat}$ to be the image of $B$ in $\\Phi^{gp}$. That is, we take $\\mathcal C = ``\\mathbb U_B\"$; the map $\\mathcal C \\to \\mathbb U_\\Phi$ comes from the map $B \\to \\Phi^{birat}$.\n\n\nSo essentially, a Frobenioid is just a way to package the data of a presheaf of exact sequences of abelian groups, plus a bit of positivity data and paying particular attention to the action of $\\mathbb N_{\\geq 1}$ on everything, into a single category $\\mathcal C$. From a categorical perspective, this is certainly something that one is free to do, but there's not really anything forcing one to package things this way. And apparently from the number-theoretic perspective, there's nothing particularly militating for this way of packaging the data. So there doesn't really seem to be anything more to say about them than the definition.\n[1] Actually Mochizuki imposes additional conditions on $\\mathcal D$ and $\\Phi$, but the additional conditions don't seem to play much role in the theory.\n[2] Actually Mochizuki requires only that $\\Phi$ be a so-called pre-divisorial monoid here, but only the divisorial case plays much role in the theory.", "meta": {"post_id": 195353, "input_score": 147, "output_score": 43, "post_title": "What is a Frobenioid?"}}

The two correspondents may well have had in mind the modern proof $(1)$ of this differential relation, but neither says so.)\n\nI can\u2019t find it in Jacob Bernoulli:\n\nWith Leibniz notation spreading, one might think that a disciple would write $(1)$ at the first opportunity. But that\u2019s not what Jacob B. does to rectify a unit circle in Positionum de Seriebus Infinitis Pars Tertia (Basel, 1696, Prop. XLV): instead, he parametrizes one with $(x,y)=$ $\\bigl(x,\\sqrt{2x-x^2}\\bigr)$ and then expresses the resulting arc length differential \u2014 also seen in Leibniz (1686) \u2014 as\n$$\nd\\theta\n=\\sqrt{\\smash{dx^2+dy^2}\\vphantom{a^2}}\n=\\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{2x-x^2}}\n=\\frac{2d\\mathsf t}{1+\\mathsf t^2}\n\\tag{$*$}\n$$\n$(=\\mathrm{LH}$ on his Fig. 3$)$ by introducing a \u201cdiophantine\u201d (a.k.a. Weierstra\u00df) substitution $\\smash{\\mathsf t=\\frac xy}$ $=\\smash{\\tan\\frac\\theta2}$ $(=\\mathrm{BI}$ on the figure, as he notes; so his $\\mathsf t=\\tan\\mathrm{BAI}$ is not our $t=\\tan\\mathrm{BAH})$. While this still proves $(2)$ and $(3)$ for the halved angle and its tangent, the argument definitely isn\u2019t $(1)$.\n$\\hspace{8.5em}$\n\nI can\u2019t find it in Johann Bernoulli:\n\nWhen faced with the task of integrating $\\smash{\\frac{dt}{1+t^2}}$ in his paper on rational integrals (1702), Johann B. proposes two substitutions:\n\nThe first (in Probl. I, Corol.) comes from the partial fraction decomposition $\\frac1{1+t^2}=\\frac{1/2}{1+it} + \\frac{1/2}{1-it}$, and consists in putting $u = \\frac{1+it}{1-it}$ so that\n$\n\\frac{dt}{1+t^2}=\\frac{du}{2iu}=d\\left[\\frac1{2i}\\log\\frac{1+it}{1-it}\\right]\n$.\n\nThe second (in Probl. II) consists in putting $u=\\frac1{1+t^2}$ so that $\\frac{dt}{1+t^2} = \\frac{-du}{\\sqrt{4(u-u^2)}}$, which he knows (perhaps by recognizing half $(*)$ with $x=2(1-u)$?) is a \u201ccircular sector or arc differential\u201d.\n\n\nNeither of these is the substitution $\\theta = \\tan^{-1}(t)$, which via $(1)$ would have led directly to $\\frac{dt}{1+t^2} = d\\theta$. And in later papers (1712, 1719) Bernoulli is content to describe this relation as \u201cwell-known\u201d.\n\nI can\u2019t find it in de Moivre:\n\nSchneider (1968, footnotes 248 & 250) seems to claim that a 1708 letter of de Moivre to Bernoulli has the proof $(1)$ and also the \u201cEuler\u201d formula $\\theta=\\smash{\\frac1i}\\log(\\cos\\theta+i\\sin\\theta)$. But this is not borne out by the letter\u2019s text in (1931, pp.241-257): there, as also in his paper (1703, p.1124) and book (1730, p.44), de Moivre simply states $\\smash{d\\theta=\\frac{dt}{1+t^2}}$ without proving it anew.\n\nI can\u2019t find it in Euler:\n\nEuler was of course well aware of $(2)$, which appears for instance in his fifth paper (1729, pp.93, 95) and in his later E60, 65, 66, 125, 129, 130, 162, 217, 391, 475, 482, etc. But when it comes to proving $(2)$ or $(3)$, then again he seems to eschew $(1)$:\n\nIn his precalculus book (1748, \u00a7\u00a7139-140) he chooses to first establish Bernoulli\u2019s above formula\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac1{2i}\\log\\frac{1+it}{1-it}\n\\tag4\n$$\n(this he does by multiplying numerator and denominator by $\\cos\\theta$ so they become $e^{\\pm i\\theta}$), and then to deduce $(3)$ by plugging $it$ in the series for $\\smash{\\log\\frac{1+x}{1-x}}$. None of this requires $(1)$, $(2)$, or any calculus.\n\nIn his differential calculus book (1755, \u00a7\u00a7194-197) he first differentiates a similar logarithmic formula for $\\theta = \\sin^{-1}(s)$, namely $\\theta = -i\\log(\\sqrt{1-s^2} + is)$, to obtain\n$$\nd\\theta = \\frac{ds}{\\sqrt{1-s^2}}.\n\\tag5\n$$\nPlugging $s = t/\\sqrt{1+t^2}$ into $(5)$ then gives him $(2)$. He might as well have differentiated $(4)$ directly! Either way, $(1)$ is not used, although to be fair, Euler at least gives (\u00a7195) an alternative proof of $(5)$ using the argument $(1)$, but applied to $\\smash{\\sin^{-1}}$ instead of $\\smash{\\tan^{-1}}$.\n\n\n\nSo where can you find it?\n\nIt\u2019s in Lacroix (1797, pp.113-114) and its progeny. Still I have trouble believing it took over 100 years for $(1)$ to become the standard proof \u2014 hence my question.", "output": "I now believe that my question (and suggestion that proof $(1)$ should have become standard before Lacroix) relied on the misconception that tangent was easier to differentiate than arctangent.

{"input": "From the point of view of formal math, what would constitute an appropriate statement of the classification of finite simple groups? As I understand it, the classification enumerates 18 infinite families and 26 sporadic groups and asserts that a finite group is simple iff it is in one of these families. Now the 18 infinite families are all fairly clearly defined as cyclic groups, permutation groups, matrix groups over finite fields, etc. so I don't think there is much difficulty in defining these precisely. Much more problematic are the sporadic groups, which are \"known\" and hence apparently need no definition.\nTo give an example, since the monster group is some finite object we could just write down its Cayley table and define that to be the monster group. There are two big problems with this: (1) this table is huge and redundant, and (2) it's not easy to work with this table to prove properties of it. The main problem is that we don't think about the monster group in terms of its Cayley table, nor even as the group generated by a certain pair of $196882^2$ matrices. Instead we view it as a specific group which satisfies some properties and is uniquely defined by those properties; presumably it is in this context that a given sporadic group will show up in the course of the classification proof.\nMy problem is that I have no idea what those characterizing properties are. Indeed under some definitions it would rather weaken or trivialize the statement of classification, for example if I defined the sporadic groups as the simple groups that are not in the 18 families. What definition of these objects is actually used in the proof?\n(Side question: 16 of the 18 families are usually collected under one label, the \"groups of Lie type\". Is this class definable in some uniform way, or are the definitions individualized and the name is just due to some commonalities we recognize between these families?)", "output": "EDIT Nov 2023: Although I still stand by my answer below, I think that it's interesting to revisit this question now that the GLS project is in its home stretch. One of the OP's central questions is how to define the sporadic groups in a way that not only identifies them uniquely, but also reflects the properties that are used in the actual proof of the CFSG.\nI think that there is no succinct answer to this question, but we can get some idea by looking at the Preface to Volume 10, which summarizes the progress to date. We see that there is a short list of key theorems that collectively imply the CFSG, and many of these have the form, \"if a group has such-and-such properties then it must also have these other properties.\" In some cases, such as Theorem $\\mathcal{C}^\\star_4$, the statement is that if a group satisfies certain conditions, then it must be isomorphic to one of an explicit list of groups. To me, that suggests that there is a lot of leeway for formalization; for each group, you need to pick some way of defining it and proving that it exists, so that you can refer to it using a standard label, but there are probably many different ways to proceed that are all equally valid. Some options may be more efficient than others, but there is not going to be a definition that intrinsically captures all the properties of the group that you're going to need; you just have to pick some definition of the group, and prove its properties as the need arises.\n\nORIGINAL ANSWER:\nThere are really two separate questions that you seem to be conflating here.\nThe first is how to state the CFSG in a way that could be mechanically formalized.  The second is how to state the CFSG that adequately reflects how human mathematicians think about it.\nFor the former question, one straightforward possibility for the sporadic groups, since we know their orders, is simply to state something like, \"There exists a unique simple group, not in one of the aforementioned families, of each of the following orders: 7920, 95040,\" etc.  This is the barest possible statement that could count as a classification theorem, and for a computer, it provides (in principle) enough information to reconstruct the groups in question.\nFor the second question, though, there's no sharp boundary demarcating where the classification theorem ends and the detailed study of the properties of the sporadic groups begins.  There's also no canonical way of describing a particular group of interest in a way that satisfies a human that he or she now \"knows what the group is.\"  But there's nothing unique about group theory here.  Any sufficiently large and complicated mathematical object is going to suffer from this problem.  There will be some bare-minimum way of referring to it that in principle picks it out from the amorphous universe of all mathematical objects but that fails to answer basic questions about it.  There will be a continuum of theorems that answer other basic questions, shading off into questions that we can't answer.  It is a matter of opinion how many questions we have to be able to answer before we can claim to have \"adequately described\" the object.", "meta": {"post_id": 199874, "input_score": 55, "output_score": 42, "post_title": "How do you *state* the Classification of finite simple groups?"}}

I tried to extract some points that are made in conjunction to your question (Riemann, M\u00f6bius, Jordan), though feel free to edit it down if it is too long (and apologies to those who think this should be remapped to a History of Math Q/A).\nThe evolution of the concept of homeomorphism, by Gregory H. Moore\nHistoria Mathematica, Volume 34, Issue 3, August 2007, Pages 333\u2013343\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086006000863\ntl,dr: By 1930, the modern concept had been reached. From 1910-30 the definition (or common understanding of \"topological invariance\") moved definitively to bicontinuous (Fr\u00e9chet, Hausdorff, and encyclopedists Zoretti and Rosenthal aiding this), whereas previously merely \"continuous\" was more popular (starting from von Dyck in 1888). Prior to that, the less-restrictive \"deformations\" (homotopies) were more prevalent in the thinking of M\u00f6bius, Jordan, and Klein (1860/70s), and while Poincar\u00e9 (1895) coined the term homeomorphism, his meaning was that of diffeomorphism. Incidentally, Riemann had no notion of a topological mapping in his work.\nSpecifically regarding the question (unless otherwise indicated, all the below is from Moore's article):\nSection 2. The evolution of the concept of \u201chomeomorphism\u201d was essentially complete by 1935 when Pavel Aleksandrov\n(Paul Alexandroff) at the University of Moscow and Heinz Hopf at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule in\nZurich published their justly famous book Topologie, aiming to unify the two major branches of topology, the algebraic\nand the set-theoretic. They took as their fundamental undefined concept \u201ctopological space,\u201d based on the closure\naxioms of Kazimierz Kuratowski [1922]. And they defined a homeomorphism between topological spaces in the\nway that is now standard: \u201cA one\u2013one continuous mapping $f$ of a space $X$ into a space Y is called a topological\nmapping or a homeomorphism (between $X$ and $f (X) = Y \u2286 Y$ ) if the inverse of $f$ is a continuous mapping of $Y$\nto $X$. Two spaces... are called homeomorphic if they can each be mapped topologically onto each other\u201d [Aleksandrov\nand Hopf, 1935, 52].\nConcerning the origins of topology, Aleksandrov and Hopf wrote: \u201cWe must regard Poincar\u00e9 and Cantor as the\nimmediate founders of topology\u201d [1935, 5]. So the reader might think that he should read the works of Poincar\u00e9 and\nCantor if he wished to find the origin of the concept of homeomorphism. However, the reader would then find that\nCantor\u2019s published works contain nothing at all about homeomorphisms, and very little about continuous functions, ...\n[Quoting Johnson [1979, 127] about Riemann: What we find conspicuously lacking in Riemann\u2019s work is the notion of a topological mapping. For modern mathematicians topology is inseparable from homeomorphisms. Riemann never contemplated these in his programme of analysis situs [i.e. topology].]\nAs for Poincar\u00e9, there is a particularly interesting discovery to be made. Although Poincar\u00e9 coined the word\n\u201chomeomorphism\u201d in [1895], he meant by it something quite different from and more restricted than what is meant\nnowadays. ... his \u201chomeomorphism\u201d had strong requirements of differentiability and smoothness that have nothing directly to do with topology ... for Poincar\u00e9 a \u201chomeomorphism\u201d is not a homeomorphism in the modern sense,\nbut rather a diffeomorphism. ... [Also noted is his 1892 article which spoke of deformations (homotopy), while an 1900 article of his might have used the word \"homeomorphism\" in the modern sense.]\nSection 3. Since Poincar\u00e9\u2019s 1895 article is the origin of the word \u201chomeomorphism\u201d but not of the concept of homeomorphism, how did that concept originate?\nAt the time that Poincar\u00e9 wrote, there was a second and broader concept of homeomorphism in use. This second\nconcept was clearly stated by Walther von Dyck in an 1888 article on analysis situs: \u201cAbsolute properties [in analysis\nsitus] can also be characterized as those, for whose agreement on two manifolds, it is necessary and sufficient that\nthere exists a one\u2013one continuous function [umkehrbar eindeutiger stetiger Beziehung] between all elements of the\ntwo manifolds\u201d [1888, 457]. [Footnote 4 notes that the German phrase could conceivably be interpreted either as \"(umkehrbar eindeutiger) und stetiger\" or \"umkehrbar (eindeutiger und stetiger)\", loosely \"reversible mapping and continuous\" and the question is whether \"umkehrbar\" (reversible) modifies \"stetiger\" (continuous); Moore notes that later mathematicians preferred the first construal.]\nFor the rest of the present note, a one\u2013one continuous function from one subset of Euclidean space onto another\nwill be called a \u201c$D$-homeomorphism,\u201d after von Dyck, since a $D$-homeomorphism is a broader concept (both for\nEuclidean spaces and more generally) than a homeomorphism. But more than three decades were to pass before\n$D$-homeomorphisms were clearly distinguished from homeomorphisms. ...\nIt is a plausible conjecture that many of those who used $D$-homeomorphisms (something which continued to occur at least until 1924) implicitly assumed that every $D$-homeomorphism is a homeomorphism, i.e., that the inverse\nfunction is continuous. Such a result was necessary, in particular, if the inverse of a $D$-homeomorphism was to be a\n$D$-homeomorphism. And such a result would have been true if they had only considered, in $n$-dimensional Euclidean\nspace, sets which are both closed and bounded. But prior to Camille Jordan\u2019s work [1893], discussed in Section 4\nbelow, this condition was never made explicit. As we shall see when discussing Hurwitz [1898], there was a good deal\nof murkiness around $D$-homeomorphisms. ...\nIn his article of 1863, M\u00f6bius wrote:\n\nTwo geometric figures are said to be elementarily related to each\n  other if each infinitesimal element (in all dimensions) of the one\n  figure corresponds to a similar element of the other in such a way\n  that if any two bounding elements of the one figure are contiguous,\n  then the same is true of the corresponding elements in the other; or,\n  what expresses the same thing, if a point of the one figure\n  corresponds to a point of the other, then any two infinitely close\n  points of the one figure correspond to infinitely close points of the\n  other. In this regard, a curve can only be elementarily related to a\n  curve, a surface only to a surface, and a solid body only to a solid\n  body. [1863, 435]\n\nNothing in M\u00f6bius\u2019s article settles the question of whether he was thinking of his \u201celementary relationships\u201d as\nhomeomorphisms or as diffeomorphisms or as something different from both, such as deformations. All of his diagrams dealt with smooth two-dimensional manifolds. His use of infinitesimals suggests that he regarded his relations\nas differentiable. (In any case, at the time he wrote, examples of continuous nowhere differentiable functions were\nknown only to a few mathematicians.)\nThe theorems stated in M\u00f6bius\u2019s article would all remain true whether he was thinking of his elementary relationships as homeomorphisms, diffeomorphisms, or deformations. A typical such theorem was that a curve could be\nelementarily related only to a curve, a surface to a surface, and a solid body to a solid body. Another theorem was that\ntwo surfaces in a plane are elementarily related if and only if they have the same finite number of boundary curves\n[1863, 439]. ...\n[Later in the section, it is noted M\u00f6bius introduced the \"rubber sheet\" geometry (deformations) in this article/manuscript, similarly Jordan had deformations in his 1866 paper, and 10 years later Klein appeared to think in terms of deformations (which are homotopies, so less restrictive than homeomorphisms). Some comments are made about Schonflies (1906-8), Zoretti (1912), and Rosenthal (1924) the latter who finally distinguished between $D$-homeomorphism and homeomorphism: \"For F. Klein [1872] and A. Hurwitz [1898] analysis situs [topology] is the study of those properties of figures (or point-sets) which are preserved by all one\u2013one continuous mappings. It is altogether preferable to require here invariance with respect to one\u2013one continuous mappings whose inverses are\nalso continuous. However, this distinction is only relevant for those figures which are not closed and bounded.\" Moreover, the article states \"[t]here is evidence that even Felix Hausdorff, a decade before he introduced his version of topological spaces, shared\nthe erroneous view of Hurwitz [1898] and Schoenflies that topology is about the invariants of $D$-homeomorphisms.\"]\nAs late as 1924 some eminent algebraic topologists continued to use the older and inadequate definition of homeomorphism, i.e., of $D$-homeomorphism. Among those who did so was Solomon Lefschetz. ... However, six years later Lefschetz\nadopted the modern definition of homeomorphism [1930, 3], and he retained this definition in later works [1942, 7]. In their 1934 textbook of algebraic topology, Herbert Seifert and William Threlfall (Dresden) wrote that \u201ctopology\nhas to do with those properties of geometric figures that are unaltered by topological mappings, i.e., one\u2013one functions\nsuch that they and their inverses are continuous\u201d [1934, 1]. Thus Seifert and Threlfall accepted the modern definition\nof homeomorphism. From about 1930, the modern definition has been dominant both in general topology and in\nalgebraic topology.\nSection 4. (Homeomorphisms in abstract spaces)\nAlready by 1906, spaces more abstract than $n$-dimensional Euclidean space had been proposed. In his doctoral\ndissertation, Maurice Fr\u00e9chet had been the first to introduce metric spaces (though under another name) as well as\nhis still more general L-spaces, which were based on an abstract notion of the limit of an infinite sequence of points\n[1906]. In this context, Fr\u00e9chet carried over from analysis the concept of a continuous function defined in terms of\nsequences.  ...\nAlthough in 1906 Fr\u00e9chet did not discuss homeomorphisms between two of his L-spaces, he did so four years later in an article in Mathematische Annalen on the concept of topological dimension. Given two sets $E_1$ and $E_2$, each part of an L-space, he wrote \u201cthat they are the image of each other, or that they are homeomorphic, if there exists between them a one\u2013one correspondence which is bicontinuous [une correspondance biunivoque qui est bicontinue]\u201d\n[1910, 146]. And he was quite explicit that such a function was bicontinuous if and only if it and its inverse were continuous. This was the first time that the concept of homeomorphism was formulated in a more general context than\n$n$-dimensional Euclidean space. [Footnote 6: Fr\u00e9chet adopted the term \u201chomeomorphism\u201d from his teacher Hadamard, rather than directly from Poincar\u00e9.]\nWhen Hausdorff formulated the concept of a Hausdorff topological space in his 1914 book, he generalized the\nconcept of a continuous function to such spaces. His definition was explicitly motivated by the epsilon\u2013delta definition\nof continuity of a real function due to Weierstrass. Since Hausdorff\u2019s axioms for a topological space were in terms of\nneighborhoods, his new generalized definition of continuous function was also formulated in terms of neighborhoods: ...\nHe then isolated the essential relationship between homeomorphisms and one\u2013one continuous functions by giving\nthe condition under which a one\u2013one continuous function is actually a homeomorphism, although he did so without\never using the term homeomorphism: \u201cIf $B$ is the one\u2013one continuous image of a set $A$ that is compact-in-itself [every infinite subset $A$ of $B$ has a limit point that belongs to $B$] then $A$ is also the continuous image of $B$.\" ...\nIt is surprising, under these circumstances, that nowhere in his 1914 book does Hausdorff define the concept of homeomorphism, and nowhere in it does he use the word \u201chomeomorphism\u201d or an equivalent term. Only in the second\nedition of the book in 1927 did he define the concept of homeomorphism. There he gave the definition in a way that\nsuggests that he may have gotten it from Fr\u00e9chet\u2019s article of 1910. Hausdorff was thinking of a set $A$ and a set $B$,\ntogether with a function $\u03c6 : A \u2192 B$ and its inverse function $\u03c8 : B \u2192 A$ (he explicitly allowed both $\u03c6$ and $\u03c8$ to be\nmany-valued). Then he wrote:\n\nIf, however, both functions $y = \u03c6(x)$ and $x = \u03c8(y)$ are single-valued and \n  continuous, then each of them will be called reversibly continuous or \n  continuous from both sides or doubly continuous (fonction bicontinue). $B$ is \n  also called a homeomorphic image of $A$.., and the one\u2013one mapping between\n  both sets is called a homeomorphism. ... [1927, 195\u2013196]\n\nThe context in which Hausdorff gave this definition was that of metric spaces, since topological spaces were only discussed, very briefly, later in the book [1927, 226\u2013232]. The French phrase \u201cfonction bicontinue\u201d that Hausdorff included in his original German text shows that he had\nin mind some French author as the source of the underlying idea that a function and its inverse are both continuous.\nApparently this use of \u201cbicontinue\u201d originated with Fr\u00e9chet [1910]. ...\nIntriguingly, by 1921 the Polish school of topologists had ... surpassed French and German authors in understanding the difference between homeomorphisms and $D$-homeomorphisms, even in Euclidean spaces. [Kuratowski's 1921 solution of a 1920 problem posed by Sierpinski is noted: if $P$ is a 1-1 continuous image of $Q$ and vice-versa, must they be homeomorphic?] ...\nBoth Sierpinski and Kuratowski wrote important topology textbooks, Sierpinski in Polish [1928], which was then\ntranslated into English [1934], and Kuratowski in French [1933]. In both of these books, homeomorphisms were\ngiven the modern meaning. Thus by the early 1930s, homeomorphisms in the modern sense were the standard within\nEnglish, French, German, and Polish textbooks of topology.", "meta": {"post_id": 200584, "input_score": 21, "output_score": 42, "post_title": "Homeomorphism historically: When did it reach its modern formulation?"}}
{"input": "I've been pondering the following generalisation of a famous problem (the special case where $T = \\mathbb{N})$:\nQuestion: We have some totally-ordered set $T$ of mathematicians, each wearing a hat which is either red or blue. The mathematician $x$ can see the colour of $y$'s hat if and only if $x < y$. The mathematicians each simultaneously guess the colour of his or her own hat. Under what conditions on $T$ can the mathematicians pre-arrange a strategy such that, independently of the colouring, only finitely many guess incorrectly?\n\nI've made the following progress, which suggests the problem is quite tractable:\nClearly $T$ must be well-ordered, since otherwise we would have an infinite decreasing sequence $a_1 > a_2 > a_3 > \\cdots$ of mathematicians. Then we choose all other hat colours arbitrarily (for concreteness, all blue) and sequentially set the hat colour of $a_i$ to make the mathematician guess incorrectly.\nSo we're only interested in the case where $T$ is an ordinal. Clearly if $T' > T$, then a winning strategy for $T'$ implies a winning strategy for $T$. So the problem reduces to:\n\nWhat is the minimal ordinal $\\alpha$ such that the mathematicians do\n  not have a winning strategy?\n\nIt is trivial that $\\alpha \\geq \\omega$, since for finite ordinals, it is impossible for the mathematicians to lose. It's not too difficult (indeed, it is a famous exercise) to show in ZFC that the mathematicians have a winning strategy for $\\omega$. This implies $\\alpha \\geq \\omega^2$ since the sum of two 'winning ordinals' is necessarily another winning ordinal (so $\\alpha$ is a power of $\\omega$).\nSo far I have no upper bound on $\\alpha$ (indeed, it could be the case that the mathematicians have a winning strategy for any ordinal, in which case $\\alpha$ is undefined), and I have no lower bound beyond $\\omega^2$. Thus an easier (and much more concrete, since you only have two possible answers instead of a proper class) question is:\n\nDo the mathematicians have a winning strategy for $\\omega^2$?", "output": "It's a great problem!\nTheorem. The mathematicians have a winning strategy in the game for every ordinal $\\alpha$.\nProof. Let's prove the theorem by transfinite induction. Suppose that the mathematicians have winning strategies in the games of any particular length $\\beta$ less than $\\alpha$, and let us fix agreed-upon strategies for those games. Consider now the case of $\\alpha$ many mathematicians. I shall describe a winning strategy. In the space of all possible assignments of hat colors to the $\\alpha$ many mathematicians, define that two such assignments are equivalent $s\\sim\nt$, if they agree from some ordinal\nonward; that is, they agree on a tail segment $[\\beta,\\alpha)$ of $\\alpha$. Let the mathematicians agree on a choice of representative\nfor each $\\sim$-equivalence class. Now, suppose that the hats are given\nout. Each mathematician (except the last one, in the case that $\\alpha$ is a successor ordinal) is able to observe a tail segment of the\nactual assignment given, and thus knows the $\\sim$-class of the actual\nassignment. Let the mathematician at any particular position $\\gamma$ compare the observed assignment beyond\n$\\gamma$ with the assignment of the pre-chosen representative from\nthat class. If they agree perfectly beyond $\\gamma$, then let \nmathematician $\\gamma$ announce the color of the hat that he\nor she would wear according to the chosen representative assignment.\nOtherwise, mathematician $\\gamma$ observes some\nerrors at positions beyond $\\gamma$. Let $\\beta$ be the supremum\nof the positions of these errors, so that $\\gamma<\\beta$ but also\n$\\beta<\\alpha$ since the observed assignment definitely agrees\nwith the representative from some point on. In this case, let mathematician $\\gamma$  ignore the part of the assignment\nbeyond $\\beta$, and instead use the fixed strategy for the game of\nassignments of length $\\beta$, using only the information about the hats up to $\\beta$.\nNotice that if $\\beta$ is the supremum of the places where the\nactual assignment differs from the representative, then everyone\nbeyond $\\beta$ will guess correctly, and everyone before $\\beta$\nwill compute $\\beta$ correctly and therefore use the agreed-upon strategy for\nthe length $\\beta$ game. So by the induction hypothesis, only\nfinitely many will be wrong. QED\nLet me also describe another strategy, in the style of Alan Taylor, from what I\nrecall from a talk he gave at our seminar in New York several\nyears ago. See also Christopher S. Hardin and Alan D. Taylor, A Peculiar Connection Between the Axiom of Choice and Predicting the Future, which was mentioned in the comments.\nWe prove directly that there is a strategy for $\\alpha$ many\nmathematicians. First of all, let the mathematicians agree upon a\nfixed well-ordering $\\triangleleft$ of the space of all hat\n$\\alpha$-assignments. Now, suppose the hats are given out. Let\neach mathematician observe the portion of the hat assignment given\nto the mathematicians ahead, and let each mathematician compute\nthe $\\triangleleft$-least total assignment that agrees with the\nportion of the actual assignment that they observe. Each\nmathematician should predict that their own hat color is the same\nas it in in the $\\triangleleft$-least assignment that they compute.\nWe now argue that only finitely many mathematicians are wrong. The\nmain point is that if $\\gamma<\\beta$, then the\n$\\triangleleft$-least assignment that mathematician $\\gamma$\ncomputes is at least as high in the $\\triangleleft$ order as the\n$\\triangleleft$-least assignment that mathematician $\\beta$\ncomputes, since mathematician $\\gamma$ observes all the information that $\\beta$ observes and more about the actual assignment of hats. That is, as you move up higher in the mathematicians,\nthe computed $\\triangleleft$-least approximation can only move down in the\n$\\triangleleft$ order if it changes. Every time there is an incorrect guess as we move up in the mathematicians, we\ndrop strictly lower in the $\\triangleleft$-well-ordering. And since $\\triangleleft$ is a well-order, this can happen only\nfinitely many times. Thus, only finitely many mathematicians guess\nincorrectly.\nThe argument is extremely general, and leads to the conclusion\nthat in any partial order, where the mathematicians are looking upward, then the collection of incorrect guesses forms a converse well-founded subset. And one can even generalize further than this, as Hardin and Taylor do.", "meta": {"post_id": 201536, "input_score": 42, "output_score": 48, "post_title": "Mathematicians wearing hats on arbitrary total orders"}}

We can ask if there is a more direct intrinsic explanation of this relation. I don't think that such explanation is known at the level of rigorous mathematics but one is known at the level of theoretical physics. On general grounds, it is expected that gauge theories of group $U(N)$ are related in the large $N$ limit to a form of string theory. The first argument in this direction was given by 't Hooft in the 70's and is the observation that Feynman diagrams in perturbative $U(N)$ gauge theory can be rewritten as double-line graphs, or ribbon graphs, that it is possible to obtain closed surfaces from ribbon graphs by gluing disks along their boundary components, and that in some appropriate limit the series of Feynman diagrams organizes as a genus expansion of these surfaces.\nIn fact, it is possible to prove the Harer-Zagier relation along these lines by describing the moduli space of Riemann surfaces in terms of ribbon graphs, interpreting these ribbon graphs as the perturbative expansion of some $N$ by $N$ matrix model, solving this matrix model, which gives something containing the $\\Gamma$ function and then expanding the solution. In this proof, which can be found in an appendix to Kontsevich's paper on Witten's conjecture, http://www.ihes.fr/~maxim/TEXTS/intersection_theory_6.pdf , the Bernoulli numbers appearing in the Harer-Zagier formula really comes from the Stirling expansion of the $\\Gamma$-function.\nMaking 't Hooft idea concrete is one of the main theme of modern string theory and can go under various more or less general and more or less precise names: gauge/gravity duality, AdS/CFT correspondence, open/closed duality, holographic relation... One explicit example of that is the Gopakumar-Vafa correspondence asserting the equivalence of Chern-Simons theory of group $U(N)$ and level $k$ on the 3-sphere with the A-model of the topological string, i.e. Gromow-Witten theory, on the resolved conifold, i.e. the total space of $\\mathcal{O(-1)}\\oplus {\\mathcal{O(-1)}}$ over $\\mathbb{P}^1$, with $\\mathbb{P}^1$ being of volume $t=\\frac{2 \\pi N}{k+N}$ and with a string coupling constant \n$g_s = \\frac{2 \\pi}{k+N}$.

This fixes the last digit of every element of the progression to be constant, and hence the first digit of every element of the progression is constant also.\nNow observe that three four numbers with the same first digit cannot be in arithmetic progression unless they all have the same number of digits (due to the lacunarity of the set of numbers with a fixed first digit).  Hence all the elements in the progression have the same number $d$ of digits.  As they have the same leading digit, this forces $r < 10^{d-1}$.  \nIn particular, we have $10^i \\leq r < 10^{i+1}$ for some $i \\leq d-4$ (say) if $k$ is large enough.  This implies that either the pair $(a,a+r)$ or $(a+r,a+2r)$ have the same first $d-i-2$ digits (one can have carries in one of these pairs, but not both), hence the same last $d-i-2$ digits, which implies that $r$ is a multiple of $10^{d-i-2}$.

What is the explanation of such wide-spread usage of the term formal?", "output": "Formal, adj.  Relating to or involving outward form or structure, often in contrast to content or meaning.\n\nIn mathematics, a formal argument is one that manipulates the form of an expression without analysing the interpretation of that expression.  For instance, one may formally interchange a limit and an integral (or a summation and an integral, etc.) without appealing to a theorem (e.g. Fubini's theorem, dominated convergence theorem, etc.) that could rigorously justify that interchange, or even without checking that all integrals, series, or limits actually converge.  As such, formal arguments may not initially be rigorous, but if one knows what one is doing, one can often make them rigorous, perhaps after interpreting all objects involved in a suitable rigorous framework (e.g. using the theory of distributions, or of formal power series, etc.).\n\nInformal, adj.  Suitable to or characteristic of casual and familiar, but educated, speech or writing.\n\nInformal mathematical reasoning is a different type of non-rigorous argument than formal non-rigorous mathematical reasoning, in which one does not look at the precise form of the mathematical expressions under discussion, but instead uses more casual, fuzzier terms, e.g. referring to various mathematical quantities as being \"big\" or \"small\" rather than specifying precise bounds.  Imprecise adjectives such as \"approximately\", \"roughly\", \"morally\", \"essentially\", or \"almost\" are commonly used in informal reasoning, and there is also a heavy reliance on reasoning by analogy.  Again, if one knows what one is doing, one can often convert an informal mathematical argument into a rigorous one, though often the precise definitions required to pin down a rigorous version of an informal concept can be quite technical, and an informal statement which is intuitively obvious may require quite a lengthy rigorous proof once it is made precise in this fashion.\nAs regards the relationship between informal reasoning, formal reasoning, and rigorous reasoning, I view the Venn diagram Euler diagram as follows:\n\nThere is some overlap between formal reasoning and rigorous reasoning, such as when one uses a formal deductive system (or software for making computer assisted proofs) to establish some mathematical statement.  However, in most rigorous mathematical writing one usually does not resort to such formal systems, and uses arguments which are precise (as opposed to informal), but do not argue solely based on the form of one's expressions in order to justify the steps of the argument.\nEDIT: On further thought, I would say that there is also (somewhat paradoxically) some overlap between the formal and informal modes of reasoning, in which one argues by manipulating imprecise terms in a purely formal fashion, without deeper understanding of what these terms mean even approximately.  (In my experience, a homework assignment of a hopelessly confused maths undergraduate student can often produce reasoning in this category.)  Needless to say, reasoning in this intersection tends to be quite far from being rigorous, to the point of being unfixably wrong. [One of my favourite examples of reasoning in this category: \"Nothing is better than eternal happiness.   A ham sandwich is better than nothing.  Hence, a ham sandwich is better than eternal happiness.\"]\nSECOND EDIT: The above distinctions are also related to the \"pre-rigorous\", \"rigorous\". and \"post-rigorous\" stages of mathematical development, as discussed on my blog here.  At the pre-rigorous stage, one initially can only proceed using informal reasoning, formal reasoning, or some confused mixture of both (as discussed above).  At the rigorous stage, the emphasis is naturally on rigorous modes of reasoning, with prior pre-rigorous modes of reasoning being deprecated (and in the case of unfixably \"bad\" modes of reasoning, discarded completely).  In the post-rigorous stage, one freely utilises (the \"good\" types of) formal and informal reasoning in addition to rigorous reasoning, and moreover is capable of converting from one type of reasoning to another as discussed above.", "meta": {"post_id": 206544, "input_score": 18, "output_score": 56, "post_title": "Why do people use \"formal calculation\" to describe informal calculations?"}}

I can certainly see the parallels more and more as I learn more of the theory, but I am curious as to when this \"realization\" that geometric ideas were all over number theory rose to prominence among number theorists. \nDoes it go all the way back to classical number theory (i.e. Euler and Gauss), or perhaps does it begin with Hensel and Hasse? Any resources on the matter would also be appreciated.", "output": "Treating number and function fields on the same footing or (for instance) the idea that ramification in algebraic number theory and in the theory of covering of Riemann or analytic surfaces are two incarnations of the same mathematical phenomenon are classical ideas of the German school of the second half of the 19th century.\nIt is very present in the research as well as expository material of Kronecker, Dedekind and Weber (see for instance the algebraic proof of Riemann-Roch by the last two). In fact, it is so ubiquitous in Kronecker's work that in some of his results on elliptic curves, it is often hard to ascertain if the elliptic curve he is studying is supposed to be defined over $\\mathbb C$, $\\bar{\\mathbb Q}$, the ring of integers of a number field or over $\\bar{\\mathbb F}_p$ (or over all four depending on where you find yourself in the article). This is why the introduction of SGA1 says that the aim of the volume is to study the fundamental group in a \"kroneckerian\" way.\nAt any rate, the analogy was so well-known to Hilbert that Takagi actually says in his memoirs that Hilbert had a negative influence on his definition and study of ray class field: Hilbert always wanted Takagi's theorem to make sense for Riemann surfaces and so was asking Takagi to only consider extension of number fields unramified everywhere.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s (so to mathematicians like Artin, Hasse or Weil), this was thus very common knowledge. The revolutionary idea of Weil, in fact, is not at all the idea that arithmetic and geometry should be unified or satisfy deep analogies, it was the idea that they should be unified by topological means (at a low level, by systematically putting Zariski's topology to the forefront, at a high level, by introducing the idea that the rationality of the Zeta function and Riemann's hypothesis for varieties over function fields of positive characteristics were the consequences of the Lefschetz formula on a to be defined cohomology theory). A fortiori, the idea of viewing arithmetic through a geometric lens should certainly not be credited to Grothendieck, whose contribution (at least, the first and most relevant to the question) was the much more precise and technical insight that combining Serre's idea of studying varieties through the cohomology of coherent sheaves on the Zariski topology and Nagata's and Chevalley's generalization of affine varieties to spectrum of arbitrary rings, one would get the language required to carry over Weil's program.    \nI cannot resist concluding with the following anecdote of Serre. In a talk he gave in Orsay in Autumn 2014 on group theory, he started by explaining that finite group theory should be of interest to many different kind of mathematicians, if only because the Galois group of an extension of number fields or the fundamental group of a topological space are examples of finite groups. In fact, he continued, these two kind of groups are the same thing and (quoting from memory and in my translation) \"that they are the same thing is due to German mathematicians of the late 19th century, of course, except in Orsay where it is due to Grothendieck.\"", "meta": {"post_id": 210644, "input_score": 24, "output_score": 48, "post_title": "History of Geometric Analogies in Number Theory"}}

So, suppose that we have a function $f$ in our model of ZFC constructed without the axiom of choice, then it is also a function in the model of ZF constructed above. Hence it is measurable there, and \"clearly\" all functions that are measurable in the model above are also measurable in our model.\nBut the question is: The bold statement above is very \"meta\". So how rigorous is this argument? Can it be made rigorous?\n/Edit: I changed \"Borel\"- to \"Lebesgue\"-Measurable.", "output": "The bold statement is not true in the generality in which you\nstate it. Nevertheless, something very like it is true, if one\nadopts the perspective and philosophy of large cardinal set theory\nand restricts the kinds of definitions that are considered.\nFirst, let's get a little more clear on what you mean. One does\nnot formally use axioms at all in a definition, but rather in a\nproof. To define an object means to provide a statement\n$\\varphi(x)$ that one and only one object satisfies. What one\nmeans by not using an axiom in a definition, is that one can\nprove, without using that axiom, that there is such a unique\nobject fulfilling the definition. Perhaps one has in mind a\nconstructive procedure, but this is really just a sequence of such\ndefinitions, and such a construction does not use the axiom of\nchoice, if at every step of the construction, the definition used\nat that step is a definition in any model of ZF.\nOne can easily make a counterexample, now, by the definition: let\n$f$ be the characteristic function of the least non-measurable set\nof reals in the constructible universe $L$, using the canonical \ndefinable well-ordering of $L$.\nThis definition does not use the axiom of choice, since it is\nsensible as a definition in any model of ZF, and picks out a\nunique function on the reals in any model of ZF. But it is not\nnecessarily true in ZF that this function is measurable, since if\nthe axiom of constructibility holds, that is, if we are living in\n$L$, then $f$ is definitely non-measurable. Meanwhile, it is\nconsistent with ZFC that the set of all reals in $L$ is countable\nin $V$, and in this case, the function $f$ is the characteristic\nof a countable set, and hence measurable in $V$. So the\ndefinition, which did not use the axiom of choice, sometimes\ndefines a measurable function and sometimes does not, in the\nvarious ZF worlds.\nLet's give another concrete counterexample. The canonical\nwell-ordering of the reals in the constructible universe $L$, mentioned by Andres,\nis a definable subset of the real plane $A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2$,\nwhich in $L$ has complexity $\\Delta^1_2$ in the descriptive-set-theoretic\nprojective hierarchy. Thus, in our current universe $V$, the set $A$ has complexity at worst $\\Sigma^1_2$, and so it arises from a certain definable\nclosed subset of $\\mathbb{R}^4$ by projecting onto $\\mathbb{R}^3$,\ntaking the complement, and then projecting to $\\mathbb{R}^2$. So $A$ is definable in a highly concrete manner, without\nmaking any use of the axiom of choice. Nevertheless, it is not\nnecessarily true that the resulting set is measurable, since\ninside the constructible universe itself, the resulting set is not\nmeasurable; in contrast, it is also consistent with ZF that there\nare only countably many constructible reals, and in this case the\nset $A$ would be countable and hence measurable. So the\nmeasurability of the set $A$ is not determined, despite the simple\ndefinition.\nAt the end of your post, you seem to suggest that, (\"clearly\") if\na definition defines a measurable set in some model of ZF, then it\ndefines a measurable set (in our current ZFC universe). But this\nis not quite right. One can write down a definition $\\varphi(x)$\nthat ZF proves defines a unique set of reals, but the set of reals\ndefined is measurable in an inner model and non-measurable in a\nlarger model.\nLastly, let me explain the sense in which your bold statement is\non the right track. One of the truly surprising and remarkable\ndiscoveries of large cardinal set theory is that the existence of\nlarge cardinals has effects on fundamental mathematical truth at\nthe level of descriptive set theory. In particular, the existence\nof sufficient large cardinals implies that every projectively\ndefinable set of reals is Lebesgue measurable. If there is a\nsupercompact cardinal, and much less suffices, as explained in the\narticle Saharon Shelah, Hugh Woodin, Large Cardinals Imply That\nEvery Reasonably Definable Set of Reals Is Lebesgue Measurable,\nIsreal Journal of Mathematics, vol. 70, (1990) pp. 381-394 (reviewed by J. Bagaria in BSL 8:4(2002) pp. 543-545, as linked to by Andres in the comments), then every\nset of reals in $L(\\mathbb{R})$ is Lebesgue measurable. The universe $L(\\mathbb{R})$ consists of those sets that are constructible relative to reals.\nSo, if you assume large cardinals, and you define a set of reals\nby a definition that is absolute to $L(\\mathbb{R})$ \u2014 and\nthis is very likely the case if your definition works in ZF and\ndoes not involve set theory explicitly \u2014 then your set is\nLebesgue measurable.\nIn particular, assuming that there are sufficient large cardinals, then every projective set of reals is Lebesgue measurable, and this may provide a soft sufficient criterion. The projective statements are those that can be expressed using quantifiers only over the reals and the integers, with the usual algebraic and order structure. Alternatively, the projective sets are those that you get by closing the Borel sets under continuous images and complements. \nLet me point out that this kind of consequence of large cardinals\nis often pointed to by large cardinal set theorists as evidence\nthat the large cardinal axioms themselves are on the right track,\nsince they provide a such a rich, coherent and desirable structure\ntheory for our everyday mathematics. We infinitely prefer the\nsmooth and elegant descriptive set theory of large cardinals to\nthe awkward land of counterexamples provided by the axiom of\nconstructibility $V=L$.", "meta": {"post_id": 211507, "input_score": 39, "output_score": 44, "post_title": "Measurability and Axiom of choice"}}

{"input": "The infamous K3 surface has many constructions in many fields ranging from algebraic geometry to algebraic topology. Its many properties are well known. For this question I am really interested in the K3 surface from a algebraic topology perspective (hence I view it as a particular smooth 4-manifold).\nAs we have seen in this MO question, and also this one, the K3 surface  plays an important role in the third stable homotopy group of spheres. It can be viewed as the source of the 24 in this group $\\pi_3^{st} = \\mathbb{Z}/24$. Here is a brief review of how that goes: the stable homotopy groups (in degree n) of spheres are the same as cobordism classes of stably framed manifolds (of dimension n). In dimension three the generator is given by $\\nu = (S^3, \\text{Lie})$, the 3-sphere with its Lie group framing (where we think of $S^3 \\subseteq \\mathbb{H}$ as the group of unit quaterions). \nThe K3 surface is responsible for the relation $24 \\nu = 0$ which comes from the existence of a certain framed 4-manifold whose boundary is a disjoint union of 24 copies of the framed 3-sphere $\\nu$. The two important properties of the K3 surface which give rise to this are:\n\nThe K3 surface is an example of an almost hyperkahler manifold, which means that its tangent bundle admits a reduction to an $S^3 = SU(2)$ vector bundle. In fact it is integrable (so a hyperkahler manifold), but that is not important for this. What is important is that it admits three different complex structures $I,J$ and $K$ which generate a quaterionic algebra. This means that given a vector field $v$ on the K3 surface we get a quadruple of vector fields \n$$(v, Iv, Jv, Kv)$$ \nwhich form a frame whereever $v$ is non-zero. \nThe Euler characteristic of the K3 surface, the obstruction to the existence of a non-vanishing vector field, is 24.\n\nThis means that if we cut out 24 small balls from the K3 surface, we get a manifold $X$ with boundary $\\partial X = \\sqcup_{24} S^3$, 24 copies of the 3-sphere. $\\chi(X)= 0$, and so $X$ admits a non-vanishing vector field, which restricts to the inward pointing normal vector field at each boundary component. \nUsing the hyperkahler structure this gives us an (unstable) framing of $X$ which restricts to the Lie group framing at each of the boundary 3-spheres. Hence $24 \\nu = 0$. \nWhat I would like to understand is if there is an analog of this story which replaces the quaternions with the octonions?  \nThe $\\pi_7^{st} = \\mathbb{Z}/240$ and is generated by the framed 7-sphere $\\sigma$ which is $S^7$ with its \"Lie group framing\" coming from its embedding as the unit octonions $S^7 \\subseteq \\mathbb{O}$. It is not actually a Lie group, because the multiplication is non-associative, but there is still enough structure to obtain a framing (by, say, left-invariant vectors), and it is the generator. \nI am wondering if there is an octonionic analog of the K3 surface which, in a similar way, leads us to the conclusion $240 \\sigma = 0$? In other words I am looking for a smooth 8-manifold such that:\n\nIts tangent bundle admits a multiplication by the octonions, in the same way K3's tangent bundle admits a multiplication by the quaternions. In particular given a vector field $v$ we should get an octuple:\n$$(v, Iv, Jv, Kv, Ev, IEv, JEv, KEv)$$\nwhich is a frame wherever $v$ is non-zero; and\nThe Euler characteristic should be 240.\n\nIs there such a manifold? and how can we construct it?

Let $f: M \\to \\mathbb{O}P^1 = S^8$ have degree 240 and let $L$ denote the canonical bundle over $\\mathbb{O}P^1$ whose euler class generates $H^8(S^8;\\mathbb{Z})$.

Since the two bundle have the same euler class we deduce that they are also unstably isomorphic, i.e. $$f^*(L) \\cong TM,$$ which should give the bundle condition you're looking for.\nRemark: Maybe it follows from the results in Kreck's paper \"Surgery and duality\" that up to diffeomorphism this is the only possible 3-connected $M$ which is parallelizable away from a point.

{"input": "This question was previously asked on Math SE.\n\nEvery Riemann surface can be embedded in some complex projective space. In fact, every Riemann surface $\\Sigma$ admits an embedding $\\varphi : \\Sigma \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$. It follows from the degree-genus formula that the same is not true if we replace $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ with $\\mathbb{CP}^2$; for example, no Riemann surface of genus two can be embedded in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$.\nSaid another way, there exists a compact complex manifold of dimension three into which every compact Riemann surface embeds (namely $\\mathbb{CP}^3$), but the natural two-dimensional candidate (namely $\\mathbb{CP}^2$) does not have this property. So my question is\n\nIs there a compact complex surface into which every compact Riemann surface embeds?\n\nThe only other surface I have checked is $\\mathbb{CP}^1\\times\\mathbb{CP}^1$.

However, not all Riemann surfaces can be embedded in $\\mathbb{CP}^1\\times\\mathbb{CP}^1$: any genus three Riemann surface which embeds in $\\mathbb{CP}^1\\times\\mathbb{CP}^1$ must be hyperelliptic, but one can show using a dimension counting argument that there exist non-hyperelliptic genus three Riemann surfaces.", "output": "The answer is negative. Suppose for contradiction that $S$ is such a surface, and let me first assume that it is smooth and projective.\nFix $g\\geq 24$. Then the coarse moduli space of genus $g$ curves $M_g$ is of general type (this is due to Harris, Mumford and Eisenbud, see for instance [The Kodaira dimension of the moduli space of curves of genus $\\geq 23$]), hence a fortiori not uniruled.\n Let $H$ be the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of genus $g$ in $S$ and let $(H_i)_{i\\in I}$ be its irreducible components: the index set $I$ is countable. By hypothesis, the classifying morphism $H\\to M_g$ is surjective at the level of $\\mathbb{C}$-points. By a Baire category argument, there exists $i\\in I$ such that $H_i\\to M_g$ is dominant. \nSuppose that the natural morphism $H_i\\to \\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ is constant. Then $H_i$ is an open subset of a linear system on $S$, hence is covered by (open subsets of) rational curves. By our choice of $g$, $H_i\\to M_g$ cannot be dominant, which is a contradiction. Thus, $H_i\\to \\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ cannot be constant, which proves that $\\operatorname{Pic}^0(S)$ cannot be trivial. Equivalently, the Albanese variety $A$ of $S$ is not trivial.\nConsider the Albanese morphism $a:S\\to A$. The curves embedded in $S$ are either contracted by $a$ or have a non-trivial morphism to $A$. Those that are contracted by $a$ form a bounded family, hence have bounded genus. Curves $C$ that have a non-trivial morphism to $A$ are such that there is a non-trivial morphism $\\operatorname{Jac}(C)\\to A$, but this is impossible if $\\operatorname{Jac}(C)$ is simple of dimension $>\\dim(A)$. Consequently, a smooth curve with simple jacobian that has high enough genus cannot be embedded in $S$. This concludes because a very general curve of genus $g$ has simple jacobian (there even exist hyperelliptic such curves by [Zarhin, Hyperelliptic jacobians without complex multiplication]). \nAs pointed out in the comments, the argument needs to be modified if $S$ is non-algebraic or singular. I explain now these additional arguments.\nIf $S$ is smooth but non-algebraic, we can use the following (probably overkill) variant. We can consider the open space $H$ of the Douady space of $S$ parametrizing smooth connected curves in $S$. It is a countable union of quasiprojective varieties by [Fujiki, Countability of the Douady space of a complex space] and [Fujiki, Projectivity of the space of divisors on a normal compact complex space]. It has an analytic morphism to the analytic space $\\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ parametrizing line bundles on $S$ [Grothendieck, Techniques de construction en g\u00e9om\u00e9trie analytique IX \u00a73]. The dimension of $\\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ is finite equal to $h^1(S,\\mathcal{O}_S)$. The dimension of the fibers of $H\\to\\operatorname{Pic}(S)$ is at most $1$. Indeed, otherwise, we would have a linear system of dimension $>1$ on $S$ consisting generically of smooth connected curves, hence a dominant rational map $S\\dashrightarrow\\mathbb{P}^2$, showing that $S$ is of algebraic dimension $2$, hence that $S$ is algebraic. It follows that every connected component of $H$ has dimension $\\leq h^1(S,\\mathcal{O}_S)+1$. Now choose $g$ such that $\\dim(M_g)>h^1(S,\\mathcal{O}_S)+1$, and let $H_g$ be the union of connected components of $H$ parametrizing genus $g$ curves. A Baire category argument applied to the image of $H_g\\to M_g$ shows that there are genus $g$ curves that do not embed in $S$, as wanted.\nFinally, if $S$ is singular, consider a desingularization $\\tilde{S}\\to S$. The hypothesis on S implies that every smooth projective curve may be embedded in $\\tilde{S}$, with the exception of at most a finite number of isomorphism classes of curves (namely, the curves that are connected components of the locus over which $\\tilde{S}\\to S$ is not an isomorphism).

(Note that if we changed the relations by dropping the factor $x_i+y_i^3$, we would only have this fact up to associates.  By having the two irreducibles $x_i+y_i^2$ and $x_i+y_i^3$ simultaneously, we don't need to worry about unit multiples.  There might be a more clever way to deal with this minor issue.  One could also work over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ to avoid unnecessary units.)\nThird, the relations are homogeneous in the $r$-letters.  I claim that this will show that an element of $R$ has infinitely many non-associate irreducible factors if and only if it belongs to the ideal $I=(r_0,r_1,r_2,\\ldots)$.  Let $a\\in R$ be arbitrary.  After using the relations, we may write $a$ as a polynomial in $r_m$ with coefficients in $F[x_0,y_0,\\ldots, x_m,y_m]$ (for $m$ sufficiently large).  Note that if we use the relations in any way (such as by increasing $m$ further), the $r$-degree doesn't change, and the constant term of the polynomial also remains unchanged.  However, it is easy to see that if we factor $a$ into irreducible factors, the number of those factors is bounded above by the $r$-degree of $a$ plus the number of irreducible factors of the constant term (which are both invariants of the relations).  This number is infinite if and only if the constant term is zero (i.e., $a\\in I$), and of course conversely if $a\\in I$ then it has infinitely many non-associate irrreducible factors.\nFourth, assume by way of contradiction there is an isomorphism $\\varphi:R[z]\\to R$.  Since the set of elements with infinitely many non-associate irreducible factors is an invariant of isomorphisms, and since the third fact above also holds for $R[z]$, we see that the preimage of $r_0$ under $\\varphi$ must belong to the ideal generated by $(r_0,r_1,r_2,\\ldots)$ in $R[z]$.  Thus, there is some element $b\\in R[z]$ and some $k\\geq 0$ so that $\\varphi(r_k b)=r_0$.

In the noncompact case he proceeds by a reduction process to the compact case. The process involves decomposing the manifold into smaller neighborhoods each diffeomorphic to disks/balls. \nVery roughly speaking, Nash then took a partition of unity adapted to this system of neighborhoods, and used that to cut-off the Riemannian metric on the original manifold to these disks. Now, the truncated objects are no longer Riemannian metrics (since they are not everywhere positive definite); but since the problem is not really that of geometry but that of PDEs in this setting, this is not an obstruction. \nWhen two neighborhoods overlap, the cut-off function is less than 1 for both of the pieces. So each of the neighborhood inherits \"a portion of the metric\". \nIn other words, the phrase that you are asking about is just Nash trying to describe the idea of a \"partition of unity\" without using exactly those words. \nThis is in regards to the second portion of the scheme. After dividing into disks and keeping track of their overlaps (using what Nash called \"classes\"; that's also the sense of the word in Solovay's message), it is possible to (very roughly speaking) replace the disks by spheres. You do this using that the disks can be topologically identified with the sphere with a closed disk removed, and that the \"portion of the metric\" on the disc is cut-off so that it approaches 0 smoothly on the boundary. This is just largely playing with cut-off functions. \nNow, each sphere has an isometric embedding into some Euclidean space by the theorem for compact manifolds (proven earlier in the paper). So all remains is to somehow reassemble all these spheres into one larger Euclidean space while guaranteeing that there are no self-intersections. \n(Remark: the method of assembly works. Full stop. So if you are happy with an isometric immersion then you are done. The problem that Solovay pointed out has to do with the embedding (non-self-intersecting) part.)\nThe method of assembly goes something like this. \na. The choice of the disks earlier means that the disks can be divided into some finitely many classes, such that two disks of the same class cannot intersect. \nb. For each class, construct a smooth map from $M$ such that points within the discs of that class are sent to the image of the embedding of the corresponding sphere. But points outside the disks of that class are sent to the origin. \nc. Take the cartesian product over the classes. This guarantees an immersion. \nTo get non-self-intersection Nash tried to exploit the fact that his isometric embedding theorem in the compact case allows one to squeeze the manifold into arbitrarily small neighborhoods. So within each class he can arrange for the different disks to be almost disjointly embedded. He claims that this is enough. Solovay showed that there is a hole in the argument. See below the cut for more info. \n\n\nIncidentally, Nash's paper is available here; the portion that concerns questions 3 and 4 are all in part D, which is decidedly in the \"easy\" part of the paper. (The hard analytic stuff all happened in part B; here it is essentially combinatorics.)\n\nTo reveal the \"logic problem\" with the embedding proof, we remove all unnecessary portions of the proof and focus on the argument that \"ensures\" non-self-intersection. This operates entirely on the level of sets and does not require any geometry or analysis. \nWhat Nash did boils down to:\nGiven a set $M$, he showed that we can decompose $M$ as the union of a bunch of sets $U^{(i)}_j$. The index $i$ runs from $1, \\ldots, n+1$ (a finite number). The index $j$ can be infinite. Each $U^{(i)}_j$ has a subset within called $V^{(i)}_j$, and the union of all these subsets $V^{(i)}_j$ is also assumed to cover $M$. \nFor each $i$ Nash finds a space $X^{(i)}$, and a point $x^{(i)}\\in X^{(i)}$, and for each $j$ there is an injective mapping $\\psi^{(i)}_j: U^{(i)}_j \\to X^{(i)}\\setminus \\{x^{(i)}\\}$. Since $U^{(i)}_j$ and $U^{(i)}_k$ do not intersect unless $j = k$, for each $i$ we can extend this to a map\n$$ \\psi^{(i)}: M \\to X^{(i)}$$\nby requiring\n$$ \\psi^{(i)}(p) = \\begin{cases} \\psi^{(i)}_j(p), &p\\in U^{(i)}_j \\\\\nx^{(i)}, &\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases} $$\nLet $X = X^{(1)} \\times X^{(2)} \\cdots \\times X^{(n+1)}$. We are interested in the map\n$$ \\psi: M \\to X = \\psi^{(1)}\\times \\psi^{(2)}\\times \\cdots \\times \\psi^{(n+1)}.$$\nWe want to show that $\\psi$ is injective. \nNash's idea:\n\nWe can assume that $\\psi^{(i)}(V^{(i)}_j) \\cap \\psi^{(i)}(U^{(i)}_k) = \\emptyset$ if $k > j$. (This he achieves by the fact that isometric embedding can be \"made small\".) \n\nHe claims this is enough to show injectivity of $\\psi$, because:\n\nIf $p,q\\in U^{(i)}_j$ for the same $i,j$, then we are done because $\\psi^{(i)}_j$ is by construction injective. \nIf $p \\in U^{(i)}_j$ and $q \\not\\in U^{(i)}_k$ for for any $k$, then we know $\\psi^{(i)}(p) \\neq x^{(i)} = \\psi^{(i)}(q)$ by construction, and so we are done. \nSo the main worry is that $p\\in U^{(i)}_j$ and $q \\in U^{(i)}_k$ for some different $j,k$. To deal with this, Nash argued thus (I paraphrase)\n\n\nSince the $V$'s cover $M$, $p$ is in some $V^{(i)}_j$ and similarly $q$. So either $q$ does not belong to any $U^{(i)}_*$ in which case we are done by point 2, or $q$ belongs to some $U^{(i)}_k$. If $k > j$ by Nash's idea their images are disjoint, so we get injectivity. If $k = j$ we are done by point 1. If $k < j$ we swap the roles of $p$ and $q$. \n\nThe bold phrase was not stated as such in Nash's original paper, but it was his intent. Stated in this form, however, it becomes clear what the problem is: in the argument $p$ and $q$ is not symmetric! One cannot simply swap the roles of $p$ and $q$. It could easily be the case that $q \\in U^{(i)}_k \\setminus V^{(i)}_k$ and then the idea of making the images of $U^{(i)}_*$ \"almost disjoint\" fails to yield anything useful. \nSolovay's message instantiates this observation by setting up a situation where\n$$ p \\in (U^{(1)}_1 \\setminus V^{(1)}_1) \\cap V^{(2)}_2 $$\nand\n$$ q \\in (U^{(2)}_1 \\setminus V^{(2)}_1) \\cap V^{(1)}_2 $$\nand both not in any other $U^{(i)}_j$. \n\nSo in terms of the turn of phrase Nash used:\n\"points local enough to any point\" == we take $p \\in U^{(i)}_j$ and $q \\in U^{(k)}_l$ (they are in neighborhoods of some point)\n\"it was spread out and differentiated perfectly\" == the map $\\psi(p) \\neq \\psi(q)$ (is injective; \"differentiated\" in the sense of \"to tell apart\")\n\"if you take points close enough to one point\" == if $i = k$ and $j = l$ (in the same neighborhood)\n\"but for two different points it could happen that they were mapped onto the same point.\" == injectivity may fail otherwise.", "meta": {"post_id": 242083, "input_score": 25, "output_score": 43, "post_title": "Questions on J.

Since $\\alpha$ is an algebraic integer, $A$ is a discrete full rank sublattice of $V$. Each archimedean norm $| \\ |_v$ extends to a continuous homogenous function $V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ and we define $|\\ |$ on $V$ by \n$$|x|^2 = \\sum_v |x|_v^2$$\nwhere the sum is over archimedean places, this is a positive definite norm on $V$.

Write $B_R$ for the closed ball of radius $R$ around $0$.\nStep $1$: There is a nonnegative integer matrix $C$ whose rows sum to $2$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha$.\nChoose $M$ large enough that a ball of radius $M$, centered anywhere in $V$, contains a point of $A$. In other words, choose $M$ larger than the covering radius of the lattice $A$.\nChoose $R$ large enough that $cR/2+M < R$. \nI claim that, for any $z \\in B_R \\cap A$, there are $z_1$ and $z_2 \\in B_R \\cap A$ such that $\\alpha z = z_1 + z_2$. Proof: Let $z_1$ be the nearest point of $A$ to $\\alpha z/2$, and let $z_2 = \\alpha z - z_1$. Then $|z_1 - \\alpha z/2| = |z_2 - \\alpha z/2| \\leq M$ so $|z_1|$, $|z_2| \\leq |\\alpha z/2| + M \\leq cR/2 + M \\leq R$. We have shown that $z_1$ and $z_2$ are in $B_R \\cap A$ as desired.\nLet $z_1$, $z_2$, ..., $z_N$ be the points of $B_R \\cap A$ and choose a way to write each $\\alpha z_i$ as $z_{j_1}+z_{j_2}$. Then the matrix $C$ which has $1$'s in positions $(i,j_1)$ and $(i,j_2)$ (and a $2$ if $j_1=j_2$) and $0$'s elsewhere has eigenvector $(z_1 \\ z_2 \\ \\cdots \\ z_N)^T$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha$ and all rows sum to $2$.\nBefore heading into step $2$, it is convenient to modify this argument slightly. Take $M$ large enough that any ball of radius $M$ contains at least $3$ points of $A$. In this way, we can ensure that, for any $z \\in B_R \\cap A$ we can write $\\alpha z = z_1 + z_2$ with $z_1$, $z_2 \\in B_R \\cap A \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$. \nWe can then take $z_1$, $z_2$, $\\dots$, $z_N$ be the points of $B_R \\cap A \\setminus \\{ 0 \\}$. It will be convenient at the next step to make sure none of the entries of our eigenvector are $0$.\nStep $2$: We may assume that there is no way to permute the rows and columns of $C$ to give it the block structure $\\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} \\ast & 0 \\\\ \\ast & \\ast \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$. In other words, $C$ is irreducible in the sense of the Perron-Frobenius theorem.\nSuppose we could permute the rows and columns, so $C = \\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} C_{11} & 0 \\\\ C_{21} & C_{22} \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$ and $C \\vec{z} = \\alpha \\vec{z}$ where we can write the eigenvector $\\vec{z}$ as $\\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} \\vec{z}_1 \\\\ \\vec{z}_2 \\end{smallmatrix} \\right)$. Then $C_{11}\\vec{z}_1 = \\alpha \\vec{z}_1$ We arranged above that none of the components of $\\vec{z}$ is $0$, so $\\vec{z}_1 \\neq 0$. We see $C_{11}$ is a smaller matrix with eigenvalue $\\alpha$ and row sums $2$, and we may consider it instead.\nStep $3$: Making the column sums $2$. So now $C$ has row sums $2$, meaning that $(1 \\ 1 \\ \\cdots \\ 1)^T$ is a right eigenvector with eigenvalue $2$. Let $(d_1 \\ d_2\\ \\cdots \\ d_n)$ be the corresponding left eigenvector. By Perron-Frobenius, the $d_i$ are all positive. Since the corresponding eigenvalue is rational, the $d_i$ can be taken to be integers. \nBuild a new matrix $D$ of size $\\sum d_i \\times \\sum d_i$, broken into $d_i \\times d_j$ blocks. We will arrange that it has eigenvalue $\\alpha$ with corresponding eigenvector $\\vec{w}:=(z_1 \\ z_1 \\cdots z_1 z_2 z_2 \\cdots z_2 \\cdots )^T$ where $z_i$ is repeated $d_i$ times. \nWithin the $d_i \\times d_j$ block, we will place $C_{ij}$ ones in each row. This is enough to force $D \\vec{w} = \\alpha \\vec{w}$ and to force the row sums to be $2$.\nMoreover, within the $d_j$ columns in the $j$-th block, there will be a total of $\\sum_i C_{ij} d_i$ ones. We have $\\sum_i C_{ij} d_i = 2 d_j$ by the choice of $d$ as a left eigenvector. \nSo we can place $2$ of them in each column and we win.\nBy the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem, a nonnegative integer matrix with row and column sums $2$ is a sum of two permutation matrices. QED\n\nHere is an illustration of the trick at the end. Let\n$$C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&0\\\\1&0&1\\\\2&0&0 \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n The left eigenvector of $2$ is $(4,2,1)$. \nLet \n$$D = \n\\left[ \n\\begin{array}{|cccc|cc|c|}\n\\hline\n1& 0 & 0&0  & 1& 0    &0\\\\\n1& 0 & 0&0  & 1& 0    &0\\\\\n0& 1 & 0&0  & 0& 1    &0\\\\\n0& 1 & 0&0  & 0& 1    &0\\\\\n\\hline\n0& 0 & 1&0   &0& 0    &1\\\\\n0& 0 & 1&0   &0& 0    &1\\\\\n\\hline\n0& 0 & 0&2   &0& 0    &0\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array} \\right]$$\nThen $D$ has the same eigenvalues as $C$, plus a bunch of $0$ eigenvalues.", "meta": {"post_id": 263885, "input_score": 36, "output_score": 44, "post_title": "Tell me an algebraic integer that isn't an eigenvalue of the sum of two permutations"}}

I unfortunately don't at the moment; I might add to this answer once I find my copy, if I find anything else to say.\nI must also make one terminological caveat: Hilbert, and later Godel, used the phrase \"recursive function\" in a way very different from the modern sense (= computable); they considered a truly huge range of recursions, to the point that plausibly every function of natural numbers could be recursive in this sense. \nAccording to Dreben and Kanamori, Hilbert's goal was to use proof theory to show that from any (formal) disproof of the continuum hypothesis, he could produce a proof of the continuum hypothesis. As Dreben and Kanamori observe, even if he could accomplish this he wouldn't have proved CH, merely the consistency of CH, but even this didn't work. \nThey isolate two crucial lemmas in Hilbert's claimed proof. The second lemma was a technical one, comparing forms of definition-by-recursion, and Dreben and Kanamori state that \"there is a sense in which Hilbert's Lemma II is correct.\" The first lemma, however, is the crucial one, where Hilbert claims to be able to transform any disproof of CH into one which only invokes \"$\\epsilon$-free\" definitions of functions - in more detail, \n\n\"functions defined, without the use of the symbol $\\epsilon$, by means merely of ordinary and transfinite recursion, so that the transfinite appears only in the guise of the universal quantifier.\"\n\nFrom Lemma I Hilbert concludes that\n\n\"in order to prove the continuum theorem, it is essential to correlate those definitions of number-theoretic functions that are free from the symbol $\\epsilon$ one-to-one with [the countable ordinals].\"\n\nThis represented a huge step forwards in recursion theory, at least in spirit: as Dreben and Kanamori write, \"Hilbert was the first to consider number-theoretic functions defined through recursions more general than primitive recursion.\"\nHowever, even assuming he could carry out the substitution claimed by Lemma I, his use of the lemma is flawed: why is it enough to consider only those functions which appear in claimed disproofs of CH? This wouldn't even establish consistency! But this was something Hilbert missed; according to Dreben and Kanamori,\n\nHilbert seems to have believed that there can be no number-theoretic functions unless definable in some formal proof.\n\nOf course they go on to say more, but I think the above gives a good introduction to their discussion, which you should read for a full answer to the first part of your question.  \nIn answer to the second - whether the argument could be salvaged and applied in, say, $L$ - I think the answer is that the proof that CH holds in $L$ could be viewed as a spiritual cousin of Hilbert's attempt, but Hilbert's ideas probably wouldn't get you all the way; and far more fundamentally, the need for an argument that $L$ satisfies ZFC is something that never occurred to Hilbert in any guise. Hilbert's assumption that \"there can be no number-theoretic functions unless definable in some formal proof\" can be weakened to \"there is a model of ZFC in which there can be no number-theoretic functions unless definable in some formal proof,\" but of course even that would have to be proved.\n\nEDIT: Let me elaborate on my last paragraph, specifically the sub-question:\n\nTo what extent can Hilbert's sketch be viewed as a precursor of Godel's proof of the consistency of ZFC+CH via $L$? \n\nA closely related question is: what did Godel think about the two?\nAt least early on, Godel interpreted Hilbert's program quite generously, explicitly connecting it with his own proof(s) in two lectures (see below). Others did, too: for instance, Bernays, in his 1940 review of Godel's paper, wrote \"The whole Godel reasoning may also be considered as a way of modifying the Hilbert project.\" \nAt the same time, though, this analogy - and its implicit interpretation of Hilbert's program - can be seriously criticized. Indeed, Godel's own opinion seems to have changed over time, as can be seen in his 1965 response to a letter from van Heijenoort quoting Bernays (to be found in the Collected Works); I'll quote from this below. In his introduction to the lectures in the Collected Works, Solovay is harsher: he argues that in fact Godel\u2019s generous interpretation was \"not only excessively generous but downright misleading.\" (Personally I find Solovay\u2019s criticisms very on-point, but I might not go that far.) \nSo this is clearly a bit of a subtle question. In what follows I'll try to dig into Godel's original sympathetic interpretation a bit. Keep in mind that I am wildly unqualified to give an historical interpretation of Hilbert and Godel, but hey, this is the internet, that\u2019s what it\u2019s for.\n(The relevant parts of the Collected Works are pages 114-155 and 175-189 of vol. 3. The lectures in question are a 1939 lecture in Gottingen and a 1940 lecture at Brown University; note that this was right after his proof, and at the same time as Bernays' comparison quoted above.)\nGodel opened his 1940 lecture at Brown University by explicitly drawing the analogy between his arguments and Hilbert's: \"If I want to sketch a proof for the consistency of Cantor's continuum hypothesis, I have a choice between many possibilities. Just recently I have succeeded in giving the proof a new shape which makes it somewhat similar to Hilbert's program presented in his lecture.\" During the lecture, he then repeatedly compares his approach to Hilbert's program, e.g. \"The difference between this notion of recursiveness and the one that Hilbert seems to have had in mind is chiefly that I allow quantifiers to occur in the definiens.\"\nThe relevant passages in the 1940 lecture are brief. To get a better sense for Godel\u2019s interpretation (at least stated) of Hilbert's sketch at the time, I think it\u2019s valuable to quote a large section of Godel\u2019s introduction to his 1939 lecture, mostly verbatim (pp. 129-130). And, to get at the criticisms of that interpretation, I\u2019ll bold sections of the quote below that I take particular issue with, and say a bit about these at the end:\n\u201cAs you know, the first to outline a program for a consistency proof of the continuum hypothesis was Hilbert \u2026 Let me remind you that, in a very broad outline, Hilbert\u2019s program for proving this proposition consisted in the following: first, a certain class of functions of integers was singled out, namely, those that are defined recursively [recall my comment at the top of my answer re: this word in this context].  About these recursive functions, two lemmas were then to be proved; namely:\n\nThese recursively defined functions can be put in correspondence with the numbers of the second number class.\nThe other definitions that occur in mathematics, namely, those involving quantification, \u2026, do not lead outside the domain of the recursively definable functions, or at any rate, one can consistently assume that they do not lead outside the domain of the recursively definable functions.\n\n[At this point, compare with Dreben/Kanamori's summary of Hilbert's two lemmas.]\nThereby the proof of the first lemma, about the number of recursive functions, was to rest on the fact that in the recursive definitions of functions of natural numbers one can avoid variables of types higher than those of the second number class.\nThe proof on which I would like to report here is analogous to this program insofar as there is likewise singled out a certain class of functions, or, what comes to the same thing, of sets, which I call constructible sets. \u2026 Now likewise two things are shown about these constructible sets, namely:\n\nThe cardinality of the constructible sets of natural numbers is at most $\\aleph_1$ [(and etc.)] \u2026\nThe methods of definition otherwise applied in mathematics (in particular, the impredicative as well) do not lead outside the domain of the constructible sets.\n\nThe proof of the first lemma, about the number of constructible sets, here too rests on the avoidability in the definition of constructible sets of variables of types that are too high. As to the second lemma, closer examination reveals that this statement means nothing other than that the constructible sets form a model for set theory \u2026 As to Lemma 2 therefore it is a matter of proving that the constructible sets form a model for set theory, and on the basis of Lemma 1, one can show that the generalized continuum hypothesis holds in that model, and thus its consistency is proved by the method of models.\u201d\n(It's worth going back to the 1940 lecture at this point, to note that - having used the analogy with Hilbert's program to situate his proof in his first lecture - he still felt it worthwhile to present a second proof, even closer in spirit (and it is meaningfully closer - it replaces the model-theoretic approach of 1939 with a more proof-theoretic one). To me this indicates that he was serious in his interpretation of Hilbert (as opposed to, say, simply presenting the analogy to quicken acceptance of his proof, which would in my opinion be a reasonable action given the multiple mathematical and philosophical novelties in the argument).)\nThe analogy Godel draws here is clear, but in my opinion faulty, because of the points bolded: Hilbert, unlike Godel, does not seem to understand the subtleties of using a model to provide a consistency proof. First, Hilbert doesn\u2019t recognize (at least, not explicitly) the importance of checking that the class of functions specified actually satisfies the given set of axioms. He avoids this by implicitly claiming something stronger: that all functions have this property. Godel recognizes the problem here, and the first bolded passage above introduces a crucial phrase (\u201cone can consistently assume that\u201d) which was not in Hilbert\u2019s argument.  This is important, because it adds a layer of subtlety to the task - namely, the appropriate construction and verification of a model - which was definitely not in Hilbert.  Another side of this coin crops up in Godel\u2019s description of his own proof, in the second and third bolded passages (\u201cthe constructible sets form a model for set theory\u201d and \u201cits consistency is proved by the method of models\u201d) which are not present in his description of Hilbert\u2019s.\nSolovay also points out the huge gulf between Godel\u2019s notion of constructible and Hilbert\u2019s (admittedly somewhat vague) notion of recursive, and argues (and I agree) that this gulf isn\u2019t just a technical point but really fundamental; in particular, although Solovay doesn\u2019t explicitly say this, I think that Hilbert\u2019s notion is too restrictive to convincingly cover all \u201cthe other definitions that occur in mathematics.\u201d Certainly to the extent that we care about set theory, it isn\u2019t enough: after all, $L$ forms the smallest inner model of ZFC! So the difference in power between Godel\u2019s constructible and Hilbert\u2019s recursive is really reflective of the fact that Godel was aware of the complexities of actually building a model, in a way which Hilbert wasn\u2019t (or at least, wasn\u2019t explicitly in \u201cuber das unendliche.\u201d And according to Solovay, in his later letter to van Heijenoort (which I don\u2019t have) Godel was himself far less generous.\nGodel, later on (in his 1965 correspondence with van Heijenoort referred to above - pp. 324-325 of Collected Works vol. 5), seems to agree - he writes:\n\"There is a remote analogy ... There is, however, this great difference that Hilbert considers only strictly constructive definitions and, moreover, transfinite iterations of the defining operations only up to constructive ordinals, while I admit, not only quantifiers in the definitions, but also iterations of the defining operations up to any ordinal number, no matter whether or how it can be defined. ... It was exactly by viewing the situation from this highly transfinite, set-theoretical point of view that in my approach the difficulties were overcome and a relative finitary consistency proof was obtained. Of course there is no place in this approach for anything like Hilbert's Lemma 1.\"\n(Recall that this lemma was the one singled out by Dreben and Kanamori as the most problematic.)\nSo on the balance, I think that there is an analogy between Hilbert\u2019s ideas and Godel\u2019s proof, but it is fundamentally shaky and arguably even misleading.\n(Again, though, I have absolutely no expertise as an historian, so I\u2019m not really qualified to do this kind of analysis.)", "meta": {"post_id": 272028, "input_score": 45, "output_score": 47, "post_title": "Hilbert's alleged proof of the Continuum Hypothesis in \"On the Infinite\""}}

{"input": "I was just watching Andrej Bauer's lecture Five Stages of Accepting Constructive Mathematics, and he mentioned that in the constructive setting we cannot guarantee that every ideal is contained in a maximal ideal---since that obviously requires Zorn's Lemma (or is equivalent to Zorn's Lemma, perhaps?)---so we need to approach algebraic geometry from a different point of view, such as locales. \nI am curious how algebraic geometry  looks from this constructive point of view, and if there are any good references on this subject? \nI'm fairly new to constructive mathematics, though I have been lured in by Kock's synthetic differential geometry, and I'm starting to read the HoTT book.", "output": "Let me wrote a quick introduction to this idea:\n1) Locales\nI do not know if you are already familiar with the notion of locale that Andrej is referring to in his talk: They are a small variation on the idea of a topological space, where instead of defining a space by giving a set of points together with a collection of \"open subsets\" stable under arbitrary unions and finite intersections, one just gives an abstract ordered set of \"open subspaces\" which should have arbitrary supremums and finite infimums and such that binary infinimum distribute over arbitrary supremum. Such a poset is called a Frame (this is actually the same as a complete Heyting algebra), a morphism of frame is an ordered preserving map which commutes to finite infimums and arbitrary supremums. And locales are defined as just being \"the opposite of the category of frames\", i.e. a locale is just a frame, and morphisms of locales are morphisms of frame in the other direction.\nIt is rather easy to go from a topological space to a locales by just remembering the poset of open subspaces, and attaching to a continuous map its action on open subset by pre-image.\nConversely if one has a locale $X$, one can define a \"point\" of it as a morphism from the locale corresponding to the one point topological space to $X$, there is a topology on this set of points (generated by the element of the frame corresponding to $X$) and these two constructions form an adjunction between locales and topological spaces, which can be shown to be an equivalence between rather large subcategories. More precisely it induces an equivalence between \"sober topological spaces\" and \"spatial locales\", where spatial locales are the locales \"having enough points\" in a precise technical sense.\nThere are however some locales which have no points at all. At first you can regard them as pathological monster, but it in fact appears that at least some of them are extremely natural and interesting objects (things like the space of \"generic real numbers\" or \"random real numbers\" that Andrej mentioned in his talk, or the \"space of bijection\" between two infinite set of different cardinality whose non triviality is the key points for Cohen forcing to works).\nDespite this, classically, locales and topological spaces are very similar (for example, if you are only interested in complete metric spaces or locally compact spaces you will not notice the difference) but the category of locales is overall (arguably) slightly better behaved than the category of topological spaces.\nBut constructively, it is a lot harder to construct \"points\" of locales and a lot more locale appears to be non-spatial. This make the gap between topological spaces and locales considerably larger. And in this weaker framework, locales become incredibly better behaved than topological spaces. For example without the law of excluded middle the correct definition of the locale of real number might be non-spatial but is always locally compact, while it is well known that constructively the topological space of real numbers can fail to be locally compact (this is one of the bad things that happen in constructive analysis that Andrej mentioned in his talk). In fact it is known that they agree if and only if the topological space of real number is locally compact.\nSimilarly, a lot of classical theorem which requiert the axiom of choices become fully constructive when formulated in terms of locales. This the case for example of the Tychonov theorem, the Hahn Banach theorem, or the Gelfand duality.\nFor example the idea for the Hahn Banach theorem is that instead of asking for the existence of certain linear form or extension of linear form, we construct a space (a locale) of linear form and show that this is not the empty space (even if it might not have points) and that the map between these spaces induced by restricting to a subspace is always a \"surjection\" in a good localic sense. And this roughly also what happen for the Gelfand duality or the case of ring spectrum that we will discuss below\nI highly recommend to have a look to Peter Johnstone excellent non technical introduction paper to the subject \"The point of pointless topology\" which will expand on what I just said. and probably explains it more clearly.\n2) The localic Zariski spectrum\nSo, the starting idea is that one can construct the Zariski spectrum of a ring, together with its structural sheaf directly as a locale without ever mentioning prime ideal or maximal ideal. For example, one can just says that the poset of open is given by the poset of radical ideal of the ring. One can also give a presentation by generator and relation of the corresponding frame which is more convenient to work with. This is done for example in section V.3 of P.T.Johnstone's book \"Stone spaces\". And while prime ideal are a little dangerous constructively as they might not exists, ideals are not problematic at all, you always have plenty of them.\nThis locale we are constructing is still morally the \"space of prime ideal of the ring\" but the question of whether the ring actually has any prime ideal or not become just the question of whether this space has points or not, which a rather unimportant question in locale theory.\nIn fact, if you are familiar with the notion of classifying topos, it is the \"space of prime ideal\" in the sense that it is the classifying space for prime ideal, more precesely for \"prime ideal complement\", i.e. subset $O$ of the ring such that ($xy \\in O \\Rightarrow x \\in O \\text{ and }y \\in O$;  $0 \\notin O$; $1 \\in O$ ; $x+y \\in O \\Rightarrow x \\in O \\text{ or } y \\in O$) which classically are exactly the complements of prime ideal, and construcively are more important because they are the things you need to get a locale ring when localizing.\nThis let you go through with the definition of a scheme in a constructive setting. It appears than most classical results of algebraic geometry became constructive when formulated using locales instead of spaces (and replacing statement involving existence of prime or maximal ideal by statement about property of this \"space of prime ideals\" similarly to the Hahn banach theorem above). Unfortunately, except very basic things, these are mostly \"folk theorem\" and do not very often appears in literature (because let's face it, not many algebraic geometer are interested in constructivisme...). With the exception of the work of Ingo Blechschmidt that I mention below.\nIn fact (but that is a personal opinion) I've always found that, for someone already familiar with locale theory, the localic treatment of the basic property of the Zariski spectrum are notably simpler than their usual topological treatment.\n3) Internal logic\nThe last step to this story relies on the use of \"internal logic\". The idea is that if you work internally in (the topos of sheaves over) the localic Zariski spectrum, then you actually have a \"prime ideal of your ring\" (more precisely, you have a \"localizing system\" which satisfies the properties to be the complement of a prime ideal mentioned above) and this prime ideal is in some sense the universal prime ideal of your ring (proving a property for this internal prime ideal proves property for all prime ideal of your ring) and a large number of proof that relies on the axiom of choice because they says at some point \"let M be a maximal/prime ideal of your ring\" (for example, if you prove that some element is nilpotent because it belongs to all prime ideal) become constructive if, instead of choosing a prime ideal, you move to this internal logic and use the universal one.\nThis produces a quite efficient and automatic method to make lots of results of algebra and algebraic geometry constructive.\nThis idea of exploiting internal logic in algebraic geometry tend to make everything constructive and has been pushed quite far by Ingo Blechschmidt (you can watch one of his talk here, or read his thesis work here)\nTo my knowledge the work of Ingo is the only place where you will find a non trivial treatment of algebraic geometry which use this picture.\nFor another example, another place, completely different from prime ideal, where you will use non-constructive things in algebra or algebraic geometry is when you want to talk about algebraic closure of a fields. But it appears that this point of view also provide a solution. In general you cannot construct a single algebraic closure of a given fields, but what you can instead do is to consider the \"space of all algebraic closure of the field\" in the sense of theory of classifying topsoes. This times this will not even be a locale, but a more general kind of topos, and it appears that this topos is something that have actually been studied a lot by algebraic geometers: indeed, if you start from some ring $R$ and study the \"space of all algebraic closure of all residual fields of $R$\" defined in a proper way what you get is nothing else than the \"small \u00e9tale topos of $R$\".

{"input": "I'm currently a young, not-so-young mathematician, finishing its second postdoc. I developed an interest for rather different topics in the last few years but constantly, slowly converged towards something that has to do with (but at this point I'm quite unsure is) category theory and its applications. What motivated me in the study of mathematics back in the days was the desire to understand the mechanisms ruling algebraic topology; then the word \"functor\" came in, and I fell into the rabbit-hole. \nAt this point most of you would expect I'm not unsatisfied with the shape category theory has nowadays: isn't a blurry mixture of homotopy theory and category theory precisely what I'm tackling?\nI'm instead profoundly disappointed by the drift that categorical thinking has taken in the last ten years or so. And this is because the more I dwell into what \"higher category theory\" and \"formal homotopy theory\" became, the less I like both of them (I will somewhat refer as both with the portmanteau term \"HTT\"; I hereby stress that this acronym has no particular meaning whatsoever):\n\nIt is still absolutely unclear what good is HTT for category theorists. To my eye, it is certainly a masterpiece of applied mathematics (in the sense that its tasks rest on the use of conceptualization as a tool, not as a target), but it doesn't seem to add a single grain of sand to the sea of category theory; instead, it re-does all the things you need to know to behave \"as if\" your homotopy-things were things, or to compactly bookkeep an infinite amount of data into a finite amount of space. These are honest practical motivations, addressed in a way I'm unable to judge; what I am able to judge, is the impact this impressive amount of material is having on category theory intended not as a part of mathematics, but as a way to look at mathematics from the outside. I feel this impact is near to zero. Not to mention that to my eye you do category theory only the australian way; everyone else is applying category theory towards the solution of a specific mathematical problem. And yet, I couldn't think of two more distant languages than Australian CT and HTT; what's wrong with me? What's wrong with the community? Sure there have been attempts to circumvent this; I feel this is a beginning, and somehow the first example of HTT done by truly categorical means. But in the end, you open and read these papers, only to find that you still need to know simplicial sets and homotopy theory and the lingo of topologists. This is not what I'm after.\nWhen you use HTT, you are not providing a foundation for (higher) category theory; instead, you are relying quite heavily on the structure of a single category (simplicial sets), and on its quite complicated combinatorics. I am perplexed by the naivety of people that believe HTT can serve as a foundation for higher category theory; I am frightened by the fact that these people seems to be satisfied by what they have. So should I? Or shall I look for more? And where? Struggling with the books I had, I haven't been able to find a single convincing word about neither of these terms (foundation, category, theory). Again, it seems that HTT is a framework to perform computations (be them in stable homotopy theory or intersection theory or something else), instead than a language explaining the profound reason why you already know what things intimately are (this is what category theory does, to me). It is also quite schizophrenic that HTT exhibits the double nature of a device taking (almost all) category theory for granted, and at the same time it wants to rebuild it from scratch. Do I have to already know this stuff, to learn this stuff?\nThere's a rather deep asymmetry between category theory and homotopy theory: these two fields, although intimately linked, live different planets when it comes to outreach and learning. By its very nature, categorical thinking is trivial; there are few things to prove, and all of them are done with the same toolset, and instead there's an extreme effort in carving deep definitions that can turn into milestones of thought (I take \"elementary topos\" as an example of such a definition). On the contrary, homotopy theory is a scattered set of results, fragmented in a cloud of subfields, speaking different dialects; every proof is technically a mess, uses ad-hoc ideas, complicated constructions, forces to re-learn things from scratch... in a few words, there is no Bourbaki for algebraic topology [edit: now I know there is one, but it's evidently insufficient].\n\nThis double nature entails that there's no way to learn HTT if you (like me) are not so acquainted with the use of concrete and painful arguments; in a few words, if you are not a good enough mathematician. The complexity of techniques you are requested to master is daunting and leaves outside some beginners, as well as some people caught at the wrong time in their formation process. Sure, the situation is changing; but it's doing it slowly, too slow to perceive a real change in the pace, or in the sensibility, or in the sense of priority of the community.\nUntil now, every single attempt I made to enter the field failed in the most painful way. I feel there's no way I can understand fragmented, uncanny arguments like those. The few I can follow, I'd be absolutely unable to repeat, or reshape to prove something I need: they simply lie outside the language I'm comfortable with. Every time I have to check whether something is true, I have absolutely no clue how to operate, apart from pretending that what I do happens in/for a 1-category. And this disability is not conceptual, it is utterly practical, and seemingly unsolvable.\nLearning HTT requires to abandon categorical thinking from time to time; you are forced to show that something is true in a specific model, using a rather specific and particular technique, without relying on completely formal arguments. It is an unsatisfying, poor language from the point of view of a category theorist and people seem to avoid tackling foundations to do geometry and topology. Which is fine, but not my cup of tea.\nIt is at this point extremely likely that, by lack of ability, or simply because I can't recognize myself in (the absence of) their philosophy, I won't be part of the crew of people that will be remembered for their contributions to higher category theory. What shall I do then? The echo-chamber where I live in seems to suggest a \"love or leave it\" approach, without any space for people that couldn't care less about chromatic homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, deformation theory...\nSo, what shall I do? I can list a few answers, all equally frightening:\n\nSettle down, learn my lesson, and fake to be a real mathematician, even though I know barely anything about the above mentioned homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, deformation theory? To a certain extent, it is working: my thesis received surprisingly positive reports, I happen to be able to maintain a position, even though scattered and temporary. But I'm also full of discomfort; I fear that my nature is preventing me from becoming a good mathematician; I am unsatisfied and I feel I'm denying my true self. What's worse: I feel I have to deny it, posting this rant with a throwaway account, because the ideas I proposed here are unpopular and could cost my academic life.\nShall I quit mathematics, since at this point there's no time to learn something new (I have to employ my time writing to avoid death)? I have to do mathematics with what I have; I feel what I have, what I know at the deep level I want, is barely nothing. And I can't use things I don't know, that's the rule.\nShall I face the fact that I've been defeated in my deepest desire, becoming exactly the kind of mathematician (and human being) I've always hated, the one who uses a theorem like a black box and makes guesses about things he ignores the true meaning of? But mathematics works this way: there is no point in knowing that something is true, until you ignore why it's true. Following a quite common idea among category theorists, I would like to go further, knowing why something is trivial. I don't want to know a definition, I want to know why that definition is the only possible way to speak about the definiendum. And if it's not, I want to be aware of the totality of such ways: does this totality carry a structure? The presence/absence of it have a meaning? Is there a totality of totalities, and how it behaves? When I first approached HTT I thought that answering these very questions was its main task. You can see how deeply I'm disappointed. And you can see the source of my sense of defeat: I feel stupid, way more limited, distracted from learning technicalities, way more than people that do not tackle this search for an absolute meaning. Younger than me, many colleagues began studying HTT, rapidly reaching a certain command of the basic words and subsequently began producing mathematics out of this command. To them, category theory is just another piece of mathematics, not different from another (maybe more beautiful); you do your exercises, learn to prove theorems, that's it. To me, category theory is the only satisfying way to think. Am I burdened by this belief to the point that it's preventing me from being a good mathematician?\nThe questions I raised at point 3 do not pertain mathematics; I should do something else. In fact, the only reason why I tried to become a mathematician was that I felt that mathematics is the only correct meaning of the word \"philosophy\", and the only correct way to pursue it. But turning to philosophy would be, if possible, even a more unfortunate choice: philosophers tend to be silly, ignorant people who claim to be able to explain ethics (=a complicated and elusive task) ignoring linear algebra (=something that shall be the common core of knowledge of every learned person).\n\n\n\nOne of the answers below advises me to \"give HTT another try\". \n\nThis is what to do. I've no clue about how, and this is why I'm looking for mathematical help. I can't find a way out of this cul-de-sac: doing new, unpolished mathematics is a social event, but I've lived the years of my PhD isolated and without a precise guidance aside from myself.", "output": "I'm coming a bit late to this party, but I'll put in my two cents anyway because they are rather different from everything else I've heard so far.  In a nutshell, my response is:\n\nYes, I agree that this is a problem (though I do think you would have done better to post only the question and not the rant), and\nWhat you can do is be part of the solution.\n\nFor a long time I resisted \"homotopical higher category theory\" too, for reasons that I think are not unrelated to yours.  I even wrote a somewhat whiny blog post about it.  What eventually \"brought me on board\" was not the applications to algebraic geometry or what-have-you (which is not, of course, to denigrate those applications), but the truly category-theoretic conceptual insights arising from what you call HTT.  Examples include:\n\nColimits in a 1-category cannot be as well-behaved as we would like them to be, and the reason is because a 1-category doesn't have enough \"room\"; an $(\\infty,1)$-category fixes this.  For instance, Giraud's axioms for a 1-topos assert \"descent\" only for coproducts and quotients of equivalence relations; the analogous axioms for an $(\\infty,1)$-topos assert descent for all colimits.\nPassing \"all the way to $\\infty$\" has a \"stabilizing\" effect that enables $(\\infty,1)$-categories and $(\\infty,1)$-category theory to \"describe itself\" in ways that 1-category theory can only approximate.  For instance, the 1-category of 1-categories does not include enough information to characterize the \"correct\" notion of \"sameness\" for 1-categories, namely equivalence (at least, not unless you hack it with something like a Quillen model structure); for that you need the 2-category of 1-categories, or at least the $(2,1)$-category of 1-categories.  But the $(\\infty,1)$-category of $(\\infty,1)$-categories does characterize them up to the correct notion of equivalence.  (Although for many purposes one still needs the $(\\infty,2)$-category of $(\\infty,1)$-categories, pointing towards the still largely-unexplored territory of $(\\infty,\\infty)$-categories.)  Similarly, a 1-topos can only have a subobject classifier, classifying those objects that are \"internally $(-1)$-categories\", i.e. truth values; but an $(\\infty,1)$-topos can have an object classifier that classifies all objects (up to size limitations).\nVarious mysterious phenomena in 1-topos theory are explained as shadows of $(\\infty,1)$-topos-theoretic phenomena.  For instance, the analogy between open geometric morphisms and locally connected ones is explained by seeing them as the steps $k=-1$ and $k=0$ of a ladder of locally $k$-connected $(\\infty,1)$-geometric morphisms, and similarly for proper and tidy geometric morphisms.  Moreover, various apparently ad hoc notions of the \"homotopy theory of toposes\", such as cohomology, fundamental groups, shape theory, and so on, are explained as manifestations of the $(\\infty,1)$-topos-theoretic \"shape\", which is characterized by a simple universal property.\nPerhaps most importantly, the fundamental idea that the basic objects of mathematics are not just sets, but $\\infty$-groupoids.  Thus, for instance, the really good notion of \"ring\" should be an $\\infty$-groupoid with a coherent multiplication and addition structure (i.e. a ring spectrum), including the set-based notion of \"ring\" as simply a special case.  And so on.\n\nNote that none of these ideas depends on any concrete model for $(\\infty,1)$-categories, and most of them have nothing to do with homotopy theory; they are purely category-theoretic ideas.  So I think even a category theorist who cares nothing about homotopy theory ought to be interested in a kind of \"category theory\" where these are true.\nThat said, I think a good category theorist should care at least somewhat about homotopy theory, if for no other reason then for the same reason that a good category theorist should care about other applications of category theory.  Like all fields of mathematics, category theory is supported and invigorated by its connections to other fields of mathematics, and the close tie between higher category theory and homotopy theory has great potential to stimulate both subjects.  That this potential has been realized more fully on the homotopy-theoretic side is, I think, largely an accident of history and personality.\nWhy is $(\\infty,1)$-category theory not usually done \"Australian-style\"?  I believe it is just because people doing $(\\infty,1)$-category theory don't know, or at least don't appreciate, Australian-style 1- and 2-category theory, while many Australian-style category theorists don't know or appreciate $(\\infty,1)$-category theory.  This creates a tremendous opportunity for anyone who is willing to put in the effort to be a bridge, teaching category theorists how to think about $(\\infty,1)$-categories \"category-theoretically\" and teaching $(\\infty,1)$-category theorists the benefits of \"really thinking like a category theorist\".\nOne way to be such a bridge is to learn the simplicial technology that's currently used for $(\\infty,1)$-category theory and \"do them Australian-style\".  For instance, as far as I know there is still no $(\\infty,2)$-monad theory with the power and flexibility of 2-monad theory; someone should do it.  Enriched $(\\infty,1)$-categories are only starting to be investigated.  The $(\\infty,2)$-category of $(\\infty,1)$-profunctors has been used for some applications, but its category-theoretic potential is largely unexplored.  As far as I know, no one has even defined $\\infty$-double-categories yet.  (Edit: They've been defined, but apparently not systematically studied; see comments.)  What about generalized $\\infty$-multicategories?  Etc. etc.\nWhile a worthy endeavor, I suspect that this is not what you want to do.  In particular, it sounds like you don't feel able to spend the time to really understand simplicial technology.  I can sympathize with that; it's difficult enough for me, and I was already exposed to lots of simplicial stuff as a graduate student since my advisor was an algebraic topologist.  So I generally avoid using simplicial technology as much as possible.  One way to do this, which I have pursued myself, is to study $(\\infty,1)$-categories using 1- and 2-categorical machinery, including Quillen model categories (which, by the way, have an algebraic version that is rather more pleasing to a category theorist's heart) but also homotopy-level structures such as derivators, homotopy 2-categories, and homotopy proarrow equipments.\nThis works quite well for surprisingly many things, and doesn't require you to learn any simplicial technology.  However, it does often depend on the fact that someone has proven something using simplicial technology in order to \"get into the world\" where you're working.  Moreover, you've also expressed some skepticism about the very idea of simplicial technology and concrete models.  I think it'd be good if you can get over this to a degree \u2014 mathematics has to move forward with what we have, even if it's not perfect, and later on someone can make it better \u2014 but I do also sympathize with it, because for instance of the last conceptual insight I mentioned above:\n\nThe basic objects of mathematics are not just sets, but $\\infty$-groupoids.\n\nHow can this be, if an $\\infty$-groupoid is defined in terms of sets (e.g. as a Kan complex)?\nWell... there is now a way to study $\\infty$-groupoids directly, without defining them in terms of sets: it's called homotopy type theory (HoTT).  HoTT is (among other things) a foundational theory, on roughly the same ontological level as ZFC, whose basic objects can be regarded as $\\infty$-groupoids; I wrote a philosophical introduction to it from this perspective.  (There's also work on an analogous theory whose basic objects are $(\\infty,1)$-categories.)  Thus, HoTT offers the promise of an approach to homotopy theory and higher category theory that's almost completely free of simplicial technology, and incorporates the conceptual insights of $(\\infty,1)$-category theory \"from the ground up\", allowing us to build intuition for, and work directly with, higher-categorical and higher-homotopical structures without having to construct them explicitly out of sets.  When I read or write a proof in $(\\infty,1)$-topos-theoretic language, I'm never quite sure whether I've dotted enough \"i\"s to make all the coherence come out right; but when I instead write it in HoTT then I am, not only because with HoTT I understand the profound reason why you already know what things intimately are (as you put it), but because a HoTT proof can be formalized and verified with a computer proof assistant.  There are already some graduate students who have \"grown up\" with HoTT and can \"think in it\" in ways that surpass those of us who \"came to it late\".\nNow, this \"promise\" of HoTT is not yet fully realized.  Many coherent higher-categorical structures can be represented simply and conceptually in HoTT; but many others we don't know how to deal with yet.  So here's another way you can be part of the solution: improve the ability of HoTT to represent higher category theory, so that eventually it becomes powerful enough that even the \"applied\" $(\\infty,1)$-category theorists can do away with simplices.  This is, in large part, what I am now working on myself.", "meta": {"post_id": 289259, "input_score": 49, "output_score": 70, "post_title": "The \"derived drift\" is pretty unsatisfying and dangerous to category theory (or at least, to me)"}}

The problem is that rigid-analytic spaces are not \"locally contractible\". For example, on the annulus\n$$\n\\mathbb T = \\{x \\mid |x|=1\\}\n$$\n(corresponding to the algebra $\\mathbb C_p\\langle x^{\\pm 1}\\rangle$), the differential $\\frac 1x dx$ cannot be integrated on any open subset that contains the Gauss point (an adic or Berkovich point); in fact, the same is true for any (pro-)\u00e9tale map whose image contains the Gauss point. The problem is that the logarithm series does not converge with respect to the Gauss norm (and any admissible covering of the rigid-analytic space will contain the Gauss point). More intuitively, the problem is that one cannot admissibly cover rigid-analytic varieties by balls.\n(Another minor point is that the kernel of the differential on $\\mathcal O_X$ is actually larger than the constant sheaf $\\mathbb Q_p$; it is the integral closure of $\\mathbb Q_p$ in $\\mathcal O_X$, i.e. nontrivial field extensions may appear locally.)\nThe de Rham complex of Corollary 6.13 is isomorphic to the continuous de Rham complex for $\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+[[t_1,\\ldots,t_d]]$ over the constants $\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$, in other words for $d=1$\n$$\n0\\to \\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+[[t]]\\buildrel{\\nabla_t}\\over\\longrightarrow \\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+[[t]] dt\\to 0\\ .\n$$\nIndeed, we know that the differential vanishes by definition on $\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$, and $t$ corresponds to the element $T\\otimes 1 - 1\\otimes [T^\\flat]$; the second term is killed by the differential, and the first term goes to $dT$, which is the canonical basis element for $\\Omega^1_X$. By the Leibniz rule and continuity, this determines the differential.\nBut for any $\\mathbb Q$-algebra $R$, the continuous de Rham complex for $R[[t_1,\\ldots,t_d]]$ over $R$ is acyclic in positive degrees, with constants equal to $R$.\nWhat may be a bit confusing is that this Poincar\u00e9 lemma is only rather indirectly related to the usual de Rham complex; one needs to extend scalars to $\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$ and do a funny completion. After this completion, one arrives for some reason (Proposition 6.10) at the de Rham complex for a formal power series algebra, and that is easy.\nEdit: I realized that it may be helpful (or at least fun) to explain what is going on in the example of the first paragraph. In addition to the geometric variable called $x$ in the first paragraph (corresponding to $T$ later), the sheaf $\\mathcal O\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$ also contains the 'arithmetic' variable $[x^\\flat]\\in \\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$ (after the pro-\u00e9tale cover of choosing all $p$-power roots of $x$). The element $\\frac x{[x^\\flat]}$ is close to $1$ in $\\mathcal O\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$ (as under $\\theta$, it gets mapped to $1$, as both $x$ and $[x^\\flat]$ map to $x\\in \\hat{\\mathcal O}_X$). Therefore, the function\n$$\n\\log(\\tfrac x{[x^\\flat]})\\in \\mathcal O\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+\n$$\nconverges. Intuitively, $\\log(\\frac x{[x^\\flat]}) = \\log(x) - \\log([x^\\flat])$, but none of the two terms make sense individually. Still, as $[x^\\flat]\\in \\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$ is constant, the differential of $\\log(\\frac x{[x^\\flat]})$ agrees with $d\\log(x) = \\frac 1x dx$, as desired.\nThus, in a vague sense, we need to extend scalars to $\\mathbb B_{\\mathrm{dR}}^+$ to get a second arithmetic copy $\\log([x^\\flat])$ of the function $\\log(x)$ we care about, and then their difference $\\log(\\frac x{[x^\\flat]})$ converges in a suitable completion.

This is the expected behaviour of the M\u00f6bius function, and through various standard analytic number theory manipulations one can also use GRH to control correlations between the von Mangoldt function $\\Lambda(n)$ (which basically encodes primes) and various other functions, e.g. linear phases $e(\\alpha n)$.  On the other hand, GRH struggles to control self-correlations such as $\\sum_{n \\leq x} \\mu(n) \\mu(n+2)$ or $\\sum_{n \\leq x} \\Lambda(n) \\Lambda(n+2)$ (the latter being used to count twin primes).  For instance, in the function field case GRH is a known theorem, but we are still unable to obtain an asymptotic (or even a lower bound of the right order of magnitude) for twin primes, though it is possible to establish the infinitude of twin primes in this case by more algebraic means.\nIn contrast, the existence of a Siegel zero means that there is a quadratic Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with which $\\mu$ has very high correlation (this can be quantified precisely using the \"pretentious\" approach to analytic number theory developed by Granville and Soundararajan).

{"input": "Prof. D. C. McCarty recently gave an interesting\ninterview (published in January 2015, and easily \nfound on a large video hosting site), entitled\n\nWhat are the limits of mathematical explanation?\n\nI think this is the best interview with a\nphilosopher that I have heard or read in a long while,\nand hope that Prof. McCarty will give more interviews of\nthat quality, and I recommend the interview to anyone.\nHowever, there is one problematic minute\nduring this interview, which is of potential concern to\nthe mathematical community: during that minute an embellishment is made of one the most often retold legends in the lore of\nmodern mathematics: Hilbert's public denial that there are unsolvable mathematical questions, his 1930 radio address to that effect (and G\u00f6del's announcement, co-located and simultaneous, of a theorem contradicting Hilbert's belief).\nThe problematic minute starts at 12 min 1 sec, and ends at 13 min 10 sec,\nof the recording that I listened to. I transcribe it here: \n\nInterviewer: Hilbert said that we will know\n  everything in mathematics [...] There is no ignorabimus in mathematics. Prof. McCarty: He did say that, and in fact, he did\n  more than say it: he insisted upon it. He talked about it in his 1901(e1) problems-lecture, and you may have heard this on [...] or\n  in some other way: his last lecture at K\u00f6nigsberg in 1931.(e2) \n  He ends the lecture(e3)  by talking about the ridiculous\n  or foolish ignorabimus, and he said that there is no ignorabimus,\n  and they didn't turn off the recording-device early enough. You can\n  hear Hilbert's little hideously laugh after he says 'Es gibt kein\nignorabimus.' at the end; and then he goes 'ha ha ha', in a slightly\n  mean way. It seems to me that Hilbert's utterance there was the last\n  gasp of a mathematics, and approach to mathematics, that he represented\n  and was, I think, common in the 19th century. That is, that there aren't\n  any permanent limits to our mathematical cognition.\n\nQuestions.\n1.1. Did Hilbert audibly laugh at the end of his 1930 radio address in K\u00f6nigsberg?\n1.2. If so, can the laugh justifiably described as 'hideous' and 'mean'?\n\nIs there a more extensive recording of Hilbert's address of 8 September 1930  than what can be found here,  here, or here (none of which contains any trace of dishonesty or mockery)?\n(Not even the file behind the last-mentioned link contains any such trace, which is two seconds longer than e.g. the version which can be found on the largest video hosting service, and still does not contain any laugh? By the way, I did not take the trouble to analyze and compare these audio-files with some specialized software; it is clear that some sort of cutting did occur, but apart from that I don't see what new insight analyzing the available and laughterless recordings would give.)\nIndependently of what the answer to 1. is, what, if anything, made Prof. McCarty say that Hilbert is on record with a hideous laugh at end of his famous address? \n\nRemarks.\n\nI deliberately decided against trying to contact Prof. McCarty privately,\nbecause I think that this question is not injurious (quite the contrary) and because the purpose of this question is to publicly set the historical record straight (to the extent that this is at all possible with such a distant historical event).\nUnder the 'usual' assumptions about 'history', 'logic' and 'reality', Questions 1.1, 2 and 3 are defined questions with definite answers; in particular, either Hilbert laughed at the end or he didn't (and I think Hilbert would agree with this, given that around the same time he thought he had found proof of the law of exclude middle...).\nAs regards Question 2, I can think of the following reasons:\n\nProf. McCarty was a victim of the well-known psychological mechanism of confabulation\nProf. McCarty had access to an unpublished, uncut version of the radio recording, whereas each publisher of the audio-file either cut the recording to get rid of the 'hideous laugh', or they got an already cut file from some other source\nProf. McCarty read some written account of Hilbert's address, in which a statement about Hilbert laughing at the end is made; if that is so, then of course this raises the further question of what the basis for that hypothetical written account was... \n\nIt may be convenient to readers to have a transcription of Hilbert's address, and a translation; this is what this nice document of J. T. Smith of San Francisco State University offers; I checked the transcription, and found it to be perfect, except for the minuscule detail that \"geniesst\" must be 'genie\u00dft', \"grosse\" must be 'gro\u00dfe', and \"heisse\" must be 'hei\u00dfe' (the same orthographical errors are made on the above-mentioned MAA-page, by the way).\nI don't think this question is unimportant; other sciences (like chemistry or physics) passionately discuss and document their history and legends too---just think about the vibrant research about the history of physics---and the above-mentioned interview casts one of the most well-known legends of 20th-century mathematics in a new and unbecoming light: Hilbert, against his better knowledge, gleefully giving false hopes to the general public. \n\n${}$___________________________________\n(e1) By the way, that's a secondary, unimportant mistake in the interview: Hilbert's famous talk at the second ICM in Paris was given in on 8 August 1900, not in 1901. Even the subsequent publication of the talk, both in German and in French traslation, happened already in 1900, so the date 1901 seems completely wrong.\n(e2) This is another slight mistake on the part of the interviewee: all sources I know agree that Hilbert's radio address was recorded (and presumably also broadcast---the sources remain silent about that detail) on 8 September 1930, not 1931.\n(e3) Presumably, what is meant by 'lecture' here\n  is just the radio address.", "output": "Constance Reid describes the recording on page 196 of her book Hilbert (1969). \nThe recording was not made directly from the live address. Instead, Hilbert was asked to repeat the conclusion of his speech in the broadcasting studio of a local radio station. This is significant, Hilbert was not speaking in front of an audience, he was speaking into an unfamiliar recording device in the presence of a technician. The faint$^*$ laugh when the technician turned off the machine might just have been a laugh of relief that this was over and had gone well. Hilbert's final sentence was a bit \"heavy\", if I would be asked to repeat this in front of a recording device I might have felt slightly silly, without the audience, and I might well have laughed to remove the tension.\nAs reported by Laurent Siebenmann, the laugh was erased in the 1971 restoration process by Springer that transferred the original 1930 recording from a wax cylinder onto vinyl. Attempts to locate the original recording for a CD edition of the speech failed --- it seems the laugh is lost.\n$^*$ Reid says the laugh is audible if one listens very carefully.", "meta": {"post_id": 294183, "input_score": 40, "output_score": 55, "post_title": "Did Hilbert laugh?"}}

{"input": "When modular forms are usually introduced, it is by: \"We have the standard action of $SL(2,\\mathbb Z)$ on the upper half-plane, so let us study functions which are (almost) invariant under such transformations\".\nBut modular forms were discovered in the 19th century, before group theory was available. Therefore, I'd like to ask how were modular forms originally discovered?\nIn his book The 1-2-3 of modular forms D. Zagier writes that this was the reason:\n\nProposition 21 Let $f(z)$ be a modular form of weight $k$ on some group $\\Gamma$ and $t(z)$ a modular function with respect to $\\Gamma$. Express $f(z)$ locally as $\\Phi(t(z))$.

This, however, sparks a few questions:\n1) I know that hypergeometric series were investigated in that time, but how did they find this one and similar ones?\n2) Did they find something special about the resulting functions, like the $SL(2,\\mathbb Z)$ transformation law?", "output": "You don't need the language of group theory to talk about some aspects of groups.  For example, number theorists going back to Fermat were studying the group of units mod $m$ (including things like the order of a unit mod $m$) and geometers were studying groups of motions in space long before anyone defined a \"group\".\nThe first modular forms (of level $4$, not level $1$) were found by Gauss in his work on the arithmetic-geometric mean around 1800, and it would take until the end of the 19th century for the term \"modular form\" to be introduced, in 1890. I provided links for this near the end of my answer here, but I don't want to discuss this further.\nInstead I want to show how one reason for interest in modular forms in the 19th century was the construction of nonconstant meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces of higher genus.  This will explain why someone might care about functions satisfying a transformation rule like  $f((a\\tau+b)/(c\\tau+d)) = (c\\tau+d)^kf(\\tau)$.\nCompact Riemann surfaces of genus 1 arise in the form $\\mathbf C/L$ where $L$ is a discrete subgroup of $\\mathbf C$. Meromorphic functions on $\\mathbf C/L$ are the elliptic functions, which in various forms were studied throughout much of the 19th century (by Jacobi, Weierstrass, et al.). We'd like to find a similar story for compact Riemann surfaces of genus greater than $1$. By letting a discrete group $\u0393 \\subset {\\rm SL}_2(\\mathbf R)$ act on the upper half-plane $\\mathfrak h$ by linear fractional transformations, the coset space $\\Gamma\\setminus\\mathfrak h$ will be a compact Riemann surface (with finitely many points missing) and the higher-genus Riemann surfaces arise in this way.\nA natural collection of discrete subgroups of ${\\rm SL}_2(\\mathbf R)$ is ${\\rm SL}_2(\\mathbf Z)$ and its finite-index subgroups, such as the congruence subgroups. When I write $\\Gamma$ below, you could consider it to be one of these groups of integral matrices.\nHow can we create nonconstant meromorphic functions on $\\Gamma\\setminus\\mathfrak h$? That is the same thing as creating nonconstant meromorphic functions $F : \\mathfrak h \\rightarrow \\mathbf C$ that are $\\Gamma$-invariant: $F(\\gamma\\tau) = F(\\tau)$ for all $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma$ and $\\tau \\in \\mathfrak h$. If we aren't clever enough to be able to write down $\\Gamma$-invariant functions directly, we can still make progress by finding some non-invariant functions as long as they are non-invariant in the same way: if \n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{a\u03c4 + b}{c\u03c4 + d}\\right) = (c\u03c4 + d)^kf(\u03c4)\n$$ \nand \n$$\ng\\left(\\frac{a\u03c4 + b}{c\u03c4 + d}\\right) = (c\u03c4 + d)^kg(\u03c4)\n$$ \nfor some \"weight\" $k \\in \\mathbf Z$ and all $(\\begin{smallmatrix} a& b\\\\c &d\\end{smallmatrix}) \u2208 \\Gamma$ and $\\tau \u2208 \\mathfrak h$, then the ratio $f(\u03c4)/g(\u03c4)$ is $\\Gamma$-invariant:\n$$\n\\frac{f((a\\tau+b)/(c\\tau+d))}{g((a\\tau+b)/(c\\tau+d))} = \\frac{(c\u03c4 + d)^kf(\u03c4)}{(c\u03c4 + d)^kg(\u03c4)} = \\frac{f(\\tau)}{g(\\tau)}.\n$$ \nAs long as $f$ and $g$ are not constant multiples of each other (essentially, the space of modular forms $f$ and $g$ live in is more than one-dimensional), the ratio $f/g$ will be a nonconstant $\\Gamma$-invariant function.\nBut why should we use fudge factors of the form $(c\u03c4 + d)^k$? Suppose for a function $f : \\mathfrak h \\rightarrow \\mathbf C$ that $f(\u03b3\u03c4)$ and $f(\u03c4)$ are always related by a nonvanishing factor determined by $\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393$ and $\u03c4 \u2208 \\mathfrak h$ alone, not by $f$:\n$$\nf(\u03b3\u03c4) = j(\u03b3, \u03c4)f(\u03c4)\n$$\nfor some function $j : \\Gamma \u00d7 \\mathfrak h \\rightarrow \\mathbf C^\\times$. \nIf also $g(\u03b3\u03c4) = j(\u03b3, \u03c4)g(\u03c4)$ then $f(\u03b3\u03c4)/g(\u03b3\u03c4) = f(\\tau)/g(\\tau)$, so $f/g$ is $\\Gamma$-invariant.  We want to figure out how anyone might imagine using the fudge factor $j(\\gamma,\\tau) = (c\\tau+d)^k$, where $\u03b3 = (\\begin{smallmatrix} a& b\\\\ c& d\\end{smallmatrix})$.  Since $(\u03b3_1\u03b3_2)\u03c4 = \u03b3_1(\u03b3_2\u03c4)$, we have $f((\u03b3_1\u03b3_2)\u03c4) = f(\u03b3_1(\u03b3_2\u03c4))$. This turns\nthe above displayed equation into \n$$\nj(\u03b3_1\u03b3_2,\u03c4)f(\u03c4) = j(\u03b3_1,\u03b3_2\u03c4)f(\u03b3_2\u03c4).\n$$\nSince $f(\u03b3_2\u03c4) = j(\u03b3_2,\u03c4)f(\u03c4)$, the above equation holds if and only if the \"cocycle condition\" \n$$j(\u03b3_1\u03b3_2, \u03c4) = j(\u03b3_1,\u03b3_2\u03c4)j(\u03b3_2,\u03c4)$$ \nholds, which looks a lot like the chain rule $(f_1 \u25e6 f_2)'(x) = f_1'(f_2(x))f_2'(x)$. This suggests a natural example of the function $j(\\gamma,\\tau)$ using differentiation: when \n$\u03b3 = (\\begin{smallmatrix} a& b\\\\ c& d\\end{smallmatrix})$ and $\\tau \\in \\mathfrak h$, set\n$$\nj(\u03b3, \u03c4 ) := \\left(\\frac{a\u03c4 + b}{c\u03c4 + d}\\right)' =\n\\frac{a(c\u03c4 + d) \u2212 c(a\u03c4 + b)}{(c\u03c4 + d)^2} =\\frac{ad \u2212 bc}{(c\u03c4 + d)^2}, \n$$\nand for $\u03b3 \u2208 {\\rm SL}_2(\\mathbf R)$ this says $j(\u03b3, \u03c4) = 1/(c\u03c4 + d)^2$. \nWhen $j(\u03b3,\u03c4)$ satisfies the cocycle condition, so does $j(\u03b3,\u03c4)^m$\nfor each $m \\in \\mathbf Z$, which motivates the consideration of the transformation rule for modular forms with factors $(c\u03c4 + d)^k$, at least for even $k$ (use $k = -2m$). \nThe top answer at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/312515/what-is-the-intuition-between-1-cocycles-group-cohomology shows how the same cocycle condition arises when trying to write down line bundles on an elliptic curve over $\\mathbf C$.", "meta": {"post_id": 302876, "input_score": 54, "output_score": 59, "post_title": "How were modular forms discovered?"}}

{"input": "Earlier today, I stumbled upon this article written by V. Voevodsky about the \"philosophy\" behind the Univalent Foundations program. I had read it before around the time of his passing, and one passage that I remember vividly is this, for which I have little in the way of rigorous justification:\n\nThe greatest roadblock for me was the idea that categories are \u201csets in the next dimension.\u201d I clearly recall the feeling of a breakthrough that I experienced when I understood that this idea is wrong. Categories are not \u201csets in the next dimension.\u201d They are \u201cpartially ordered sets in the next dimension\u201d and \u201csets in the next dimension\u201d are groupoids.\n\u2014 Voevodsky, The Origins and Motivations of Univalent Foundations\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that the noninvertibility of morphisms in categories corresponds to some form of partial ordering, whereas a groupoid carries no such information since all morphisms are in fact isomorphisms, but surely there's something deeper at play that caused someone like Voevodsky to consider this realisation a \"breakthrough\" that accompanied a significant \"roadblock\".", "output": "The other answers are quite good and nothing is wrong with them, but lest a wrong impression be given (e.g. by the implicit suggestion that the idea of \"categories as sets in the next dimension\" in early work on higher categories was \"wrong\"), I want to add that while Voevodsky is of course correct from a certain point of view, there is another valid point of view according to which categories are, indeed, \"sets in the next dimension\".\nThe point is that you have to have two orthogonal axes of \"dimension\".  David Corfield mentioned this briefly in a comment: instead of just $n$-categories, consider $(n,r)$-categories: categories with (potentially) nontrivial $k$-morphisms for $0\\le k\\le n$, but where all $k$-morphisms are invertible for $k>r$.  Here \"0-morphisms\" are objects, and it doesn't make sense to ask for them to be invertible, so $r\\ge 0$.  Thus for instance:\n\nA (1,1)-category is a 1-category in the usual sense: objects (0-morphisms) and arrows (1-morphisms), not required to be invertible.\nA (1,0)-category is a groupoid: objects and arrows, but the arrows are required to be invertible.\nA (2,2)-category is a 2-category in the usual sense: objects, arrows, and 2-cells, none required to be invertible.\nA (2,1)-category is a 2-category all of whose 2-cells are invertible, but whose 1-morphisms may not be, i.e. a category (perhaps weakly) enriched over groupoids.\nA (2,0)-category is a 2-groupoid: a 2-category all of whose 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms are (perhaps weakly) invertible.\nAn $(\\infty,0)$-category is an $\\infty$-groupoid: it has cells of all dimension, all invertible.\nAn $(\\infty,1)$-category is what Lurie's school calls an \"$\\infty$-category\": it has morphisms of all dimension, all invertible except the 1-morphisms.\nA (0,0)-category is a set: only objects, no invertibility requirements.\n\nNow you might think from the definition of $(n,r)$-category that you would have to have $r\\le n$.  But in fact there is a natural way to extend it to the case $r=n+1$.  For when $r\\le n$, we can identify $(n,r)$-categories (up to equivalence) as $(n+1,r)$-categories in which any two parallel $(n+1)$-morphisms are equal.  Then we can take the latter when $r=n+1$ as a definition of $(n,n+1)$-category.  This gives:\n\nA (0,1)-category is a 1-category in which any two parallel 1-morphisms are equal, i.e. (up to equivalence) a poset.\nA (1,2)-category is a category enriched over posets, or equivalently a 2-category in which all hom-categories are posets.\n\nNow we can see how the \"raising dimension\" step that Voevodsky was thinking of takes sets to groupoids and posets to categories: just add one to $n$ in $(n,r)$.\n\n$(0,0) \\mapsto (1,0)$\n$(0,1) \\mapsto (1,1)$\n\nBut there's another natural \"raising dimension\" step that does indeed take sets to categories: add one to both $n$ and $r$.\n\n$(0,0) \\mapsto (1,1)$\n\nSince in common usage \"$n$-category\" for $n\\ge 1$ refers to an $(n,n)$-category, it is therefore very natural to say that it is sets, i.e. (0,0)-categories, deserve the name \"0-categories\", whereas posets should be called (0,1)-categories.\nSo I think Voevodsky's phrasing of his breakthrough may have been a bit too dogmatic.  The point isn't that it's \"wrong\" to regard categories as sets in the next dimension (or at least a next dimension).  The point is that it's also valid to regard groupoids as sets in the next dimension, and that this latter point of view is extremely fruitful, leading in particular to univalent foundations but also (somewhat independently) to the recent boom in $(\\infty,1)$-category and $(\\infty,n)$-category theory.", "meta": {"post_id": 309515, "input_score": 66, "output_score": 41, "post_title": "Why did Voevodsky consider categories \"posets in the next dimension\", and groupoids the correct generalisation of sets?"}}

I can only say that such structures appear on homogeneous pieces with respect to gradings of semisimple Lie algebras induced by nilpotent elements, and (somewhat enigmatically, I must admit) that all this is closely related to the answer of Noam D. Elkies to my previous question Seeking a more symmetric realization of a configuration of 10 planes, 25 lines and 15 points in projective space.", "output": "This algebra is defined on the permutation module of the symmetric group. It was studied  by K. Harada and R. Griess in the 1970s and a proof that its automorphism group is the symmetric group can also be found in Haraada's paper (see also this one) and the appendix of this paper by Dong and Griess, which explains some connections with vertex operator algebras. See also remarks in Griess's paper here.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s there were many constructions of algebras of this spirit, in the search for model algebraic structures acted on in some canonical way by finite simple groups (I have in mind, for example, papers of A. Ryba, for example there is one constructing a commutative nonassociative algebra having the Harada-Norton group as automorphisms). My (inexpert) sense is that this literature is more or less subsumed into that about vertex operator algebras. More precisely, for vertex operator algebras whose $0$th graded piece is $1$-dimensional and $1$st graded piece is $0$-dimensional there is a commutative nonassociative algebra on the $2$nd graded piece that has many features in common with $E_{n}$ (here I have in mind papers such as the paper of Matsuo and the paper of Miyamoto on Griess algebras). My understanding of vertex operator algebras is inadequate to say more (and there are some experts who post here who can maybe say something clearer).\nThis algebra, call it $E_{n}$, has other interesting properties. Let $\\tau$ be the Killing type form defined by $\\tau(x, y) = \\operatorname{tr} L(x)L(y)$ where $L(x)y = xy$ is the multiplication operator. Note that $\\operatorname{tr} L(x) =0$ for all $x$ (I call such algebras exact). The symmetric bilinear form $\\tau$ is nondegenerate and invariant in the sense that $\\tau(xy, z) = \\tau(x, yz)$ (this is somehow analogous to the properties of the Killing form of a semisimple Lie algebra). The algebra $E_{n}$ is determined up to isometric automorphism by the associated harmonic cubic polynomial $\\tau(xx, x)$. This algebra is conformally associative in the sense that its associator $[x, y, z]= (xy)z - x(yz)$ satisfies\n$$\n\\tau([x, y, z], w) =c\\left(\\tau(x, w)\\tau(y,z) - \\tau(x,z)\\tau(y, w)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the appropriate (dimension dependent) constant that I am too lazy to calculate right now. One can prove that up to isometric automorphism there is a unique $n$-dimensional commutative nonassociative algebra that thas the properties that a. $\\operatorname{tr} L(x) =0$ for all x, b. its Killing type trace form $\\tau$ is nondegenerate and invariant and c. it is conformally associative.

{"input": "I am currently trying to decipher Mazur's Eisenstein ideal paper (not a comment about his clarity, rather about my current abilities). One of the reasons I am doing that is that many people told me that the paper was somehow revolutionary and introduced a new method into number theory. \nCould somebody informed about these matters explain exactly what subsequent developments did the paper bring, what ideas in the paper were considered more-or-less original (at the time it was published), and exactly what difficulties did these ideas resolve that people failed to resolve before the paper was published (if any)?", "output": "First, Mazur's paper is arguably the first paper where the new ideas (and language) of the Grothendieck revolution in algebraic geometry were fully embraced and crucially used in pure number theory.  Here are several notable examples: Mazur makes crucial use of the theory of finite flat group schemes to understand the behavior of the $p$-adic Tate modules of Jacobians at the prime $p$. He studies modular forms of level one over finite rings (which need not lift to characteristic zero when the residue characteristic is $2$ or $3$). He proves theorems about mod-$p$ modular forms using what are essentially comparison theorems between etale cohomology and de Rham cohomology, and many more examples. The proof of the main theorem ($\\S5$, starting at page 156) is itself a very modern proof which fundamentally uses the viewpoint of $X_0(N)$ as a scheme.\nSecond, there are many beautiful ideas which have their original in this paper: it contains many of the first innovative ideas for studying $2$-dimensional (and beyond) Galois representations, including the link between geometric properties (multiplicity one) and arithmetic properties, geometric conceptions for studying congruences between Galois representations, understanding the importance of the finite-flat property of group schemes, and the identification of the Gorenstein property. There is a theoretical $p$-descent on the Eisenstein quotient when previously descents were almost all explicit $2$-descents with specific equations. It introduces the winding quotient, and so on.\nThird, while it is a dense paper, it is dense in the best possible way: many of the small diversions could have made interesting papers on their own. Indeed, even close readers of the paper today can find connections between Mazur's asides and cutting edge mathematics. When Mazur raises a question in the text, it is almost invariably very interesting. One particular (great) habit that Mazur has is thinking about various isomorphisms and by pinning down various canonical choices identifies refined invariants. To take a random example, consider his exploration of the Shimura subgroup at the end of section 11. He finishes with a question which to a casual reader may as well be a throw-away remark. But this question was first solved by Merel, and more recently generalized in some very nice work of Emmanuel Lecouturier. Lecouturier's ideas then played an important role in the work of Michael Harris and Akshay Venkatesh. Again, one could give many more such examples of this. Very few papers have the richness of footnotes and asides that this paper does. Never forget that one of the hardest things in mathematics is coming up with interesting questions and observations, and this paper contains many great ones - it is bursting with the ideas of a truly creative mathematician.\nFinally, the result itself is amazing, and (pretty much) remains the only method available for proving the main theorem (the second proof due to Mazur is very related to this one). To give a sense of how great the theorem is, note that if $E$ is a semistable elliptic curve, then either $E$ is isogenous to a curve with a $p$-torsion point, or $E[p]$ is absolutely irreducible. This result (added for clarity: explicitly, Mazur's Theorem that $E/\\mathbf{Q}$ doesn't have a $p$-torsion point for $p > 7$) is crucially used in Wiles' proof of Fermat. One could certainly argue that without this paper (and how it transformed algebraic number theory) we would not have had Wiles' proof of Fermat, but it's even literally true that Mazur's theorem was (and remains so today, over 40 years later) an essential step in any proof of Fermat.", "meta": {"post_id": 332022, "input_score": 64, "output_score": 100, "post_title": "Why is the Eisenstein ideal paper so great?"}}

(Of course this doesn't solve the problem as this is not a condition on the side lengths but might be a useful observation).\nUpdate: My conjecture that you can invert a polygon iff you can deform it into a configuration of zero area is incorrect due to the following counterexample based on the figure included in Joseph O'Rourke's answer:\n\nThe polygon on the left has 3 side lengths $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt 3}$ and $1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt 3}$ and hence does not satisfy the criteria in the paper because $$2(1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt 3})>(1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt 3})+\\frac{3}{\\sqrt 3}.$$ However you can deform the left configuration into the one on the right which has zero area.\nIn addition you can slightly increase the short sides AB, CD, EF to create a negative area on the right configuration but still not satisfy the criteria for inversion.

How can I improve these definitions? Does anyone or any company offer this \"help\" as a service?\nI have about 20 definitions like the following (only for instance) to be improved.\n\nThe $m$-crown of a set $S$, denoted by $S^m$, is the family of sets of every subset of its index set of cardinality $m$ not containing its index, such that\n$$\\forall(X_i \\in S^m : i \\in S) \\rightarrow X_i = \\{ x \\subset S :(i\\notin x \n\\land|x|=m) \\}$$\n\n(Note: I am sure that it is a correct definition but may be not easy to understand with a not very standarized notation)", "output": "I don't know about a definition-checking service, but I can give some general advice which I think will help.\nLet me begin by rewriting your definition (hopefully correctly!):\n\nSuppose I have a set $S$ and a natural number $m$. For $i\\in S$, let $$X_i=\\{a\\subseteq S: \\vert a\\vert=m\\mbox{ and }i\\not\\in a\\}.$$ We then let the $m$-crown of $S$ be the indexed set (with indexing set $S$ itself) $$(X_i)_{i\\in S}.$$ For example, if $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $m=2$ then e.g. $$X_2=\\{\\{1,3\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}\\},$$ and the whole $m$-crown of $S$ is $$($$ $$X_1=\\{\\{2,3\\}, \\{2,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}\\},$$ $$X_2=\\{\\{1,3\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{3,4\\}\\},$$ $$X_3=\\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,4\\}, \\{2,4\\}\\},$$ $$X_4=\\{\\{1,2\\}, \\{1,3\\}, \\{2,3\\}\\}$$ $$).$$\n\nNow, what's behind this?\n\nLet's start with what I have done.\nFirst, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I've broken the definition into separate pieces and worked from the inside out. My version of the definition ends by introducing the $m$-crown, and starts by introducing the much simpler $X_i$s. Moreover, my version breaks into multiple separate sentences. Think of this all as a kind of cognitive piton: it lets the reader digest the definition in discrete steps, without ever having to be kept guessing what things mean. It also helps prevent errors on your end, by making you think carefully about what exactly is going on at each step along the way - when you write an \"outside-in\" definition, it's easy to experience a kind of \"precision fatigue\" and wind up finishing with something unclear or garbled. Finally, it winds up helping you use natural language in a precise way, for the same reason.\nSecond, I've provided nontrivial explicit examples of everything. Moreover, I haven't tried to mix notations to be more efficient - the only thing I've done is throw in some spacing for readability (which is actually quite useful in some situations, and sets-of-sets is one of those since the curly braces can blur together). This helps the reader both understand your definition and repair it if you have made any errors.\nBesides all that, examples also provide a more high-level kind of cognitive piton: in the course of a slew of definitions, they help me keep straight what each thing is and how the various things differ from each other. Really, you should always give examples of everything.\n\nNow let me point out two things I haven't done.\nFirst, I avoided using too many symbols. In particular I avoided quantifiers. There's a positive and a negative aspect to this. The positive aspect is that precise natural language is easier to read than symbolic expressions; it's almost always better to focus on making your explanation precise than using symbols to shorten everything (and the \"piton\" stuff above is a big help here).\nThe negative aspect is that unless one has some experience with the relevant formalism, it's easy to misuse - and this is exceptionally true of quantifiers for whatever reason. In the case of your definition, when blindly rendered into English your expression $$\\forall(X_i \\in S^m : i \\in S) \\rightarrow X_i = \\{ x \\subset S :(i\\notin x \n\\land|x|=m) \\} $$ translates to\n\n\"If for all [missing bound variable], $X_i$ is in $S^m$ [grammatically incorrect symbol - maybe \"such that\"?] $i$ in $S$, then $X_i$ is the set of subsets of $S$ of size $m$ not containing $i$.\"\n\nThe second half of that is what you want, but the first half is thoroughly garbled. Indeed, my first guess at rewriting this would be\n\n\"If $X_i$ is in $S^m$ for every $i\\in S$, then [rest],\"\n\nwhich is very much not what you want. And reading not being much easier than writing, even if you'd gotten the symbols right your readers might still have trouble following the definition.\nSecond, I didn't put motivation inside the definition proper. This isn't something you did either, but it is a common issue (and like everything else makes it much easier to mess up natural-language definitions) so it's worth mentioning here. You should definitely include motivation, but put it before or after the definition (or both); keep the definition itself nice and clean.\nHere's an example of the sort of thing I'm railing against:\n\nLet FOO be the tensor product of BLAH, which by Theorem 11.36 characterizes the FLEEN completely, with (in order to de-VORP the resulting algebra) BLEELG.\n\nIt would be much better to write this as:\n\nLet FOO = BLAH $\\otimes$ BLEELG.\nRemember that BLAH completely characterizes the FLEEN (Thm. 11.36); meanwhile, bringing BLEELG prevents VORPiness.\n\nNote that I've also broken the motivation itself into separate pieces: why the BLAH?, and why the BLEELG?, are separate issues and I've treated them as such.\n\nNow it's important to note that these rules don't always have to be followed. But I think one should follow them very closely if one isn't already rather experienced with this sort of writing, especially if the intended readership isn't necessarily either.", "meta": {"post_id": 339444, "input_score": 28, "output_score": 64, "post_title": "How can I improve my formal definitions?"}}

{"input": "This question is cross-posted from academia.stackexchange.com where it got closed with the advice of posting it on MO. \n\nKevin Buzzard's slides (PDF version) at a recent conference have really unsettled me.\nIn it, he mentions several examples in what one would imagine as very rigorous areas (e.g., algebraic geometry) where the top journals like Annals and Inventiones have published and never retracted papers which are now known to be wrong. He also mentions papers relying on unpublished results taken on trust that those who announced them indeed have a proof.\nHe writes about his own work:\n\n[...] maybe some of my work in the p-adic Langlands philosophy relies\n  on stuff that is wrong. Or maybe, perhaps less drastically, on stuff\n  which is actually correct, but for which humanity does not actually\n  have a complete proof. If our research is not reproducible, is it\n  science? If my work in pure mathematics is neither useful nor 100\n  percent guaranteed to be correct, it is surely a waste of time.\n\nHe says that as a result, he switched to formalizing proofs completely, with e.g. Lean, which guarantees correctness, and thus reusability forever.\nJust how widespread is the issue? Are most areas safe, or contaminated? For example, is there some way to track the not-retracted-but-wrong papers?\n\nThe answer I accepted on academia.stackexchange before the closure gives a useful general purpose method, but I'd really appreciate more detailed area-specific answers. For example, what fraction of your own papers do you expect to rely on a statement \"for which humanity does not actually have a complete proof\" ?", "output": "As Kevin Buzzard himself admits in his answer, he somewhat exaggerated his point for effect. \nHowever, I'd submit that if you were unsettled by his talk, then that's a good thing.  I don't think that the proper reaction is to look for reassurance that mathematics really is fine, or that the problems are restricted to some easily quarantined corner.\nRather, I think the proper reaction is to strive for a more accurate view of the true state of the mathematical literature, and refuse to settle for comforting myths that aren't based on reality.  Some of the literature is rock-solid and can stand on its own, much more of it is rock-solid provided you have access to the relevant experts, and some of it is gappy but we don't really care.  On the other hand, some small percentage of it is gappy or wrong and we do care, but social norms within the mathematical community have caused us to downplay the problems.  This last category is important.  It is a small percentage, but from a scholarly point of view it is a serious problem, and we should all be aware of it and willing to acknowledge it.  If, every time someone brings it up, we try to get them to shut up by repeating some \"propaganda\" that makes us feel good about mathematics, then we are not solving the problem but perpetuating it.\nSome related concerns were raised over 25 years ago by Jaffe and Quinn in their article on Theoretical Mathematics.  This generated considerable discussion at the time.  Let me quote the first paragraph of Atiyah's response.\n\nI find  myself  agreeing with  much  of  the  detail  of  the  Jaffe\u2013Quinn  argument, especially the importance of distinguishing between results based on rigorous proofs and  those  which  have  a  heuristic  basis.   Overall,  however,  I  rebel  against  their general tone and attitude which appears too authoritarian.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that Jaffe and Quinn made many valid points, but because this is a sensitive subject, dealing with societal norms, we have to be very careful how we approach it.  Given the way that the mathematical community currently works, saying that someone's work has gaps and/or mistakes is often taken to be a personal insult. I think that if, as a community, we were more honest about the fact that proofs are not simply right or wrong, complete or incomplete, but that there is a continuum between the two extremes, then we might be able to patch problems that arise more efficiently, because we wouldn't have to walk on eggshells.", "meta": {"post_id": 351640, "input_score": 99, "output_score": 47, "post_title": "Extent of \u201cunscientific\u201d, and of wrong, papers in research mathematics"}}

Thus, if either $a$ is the identity or $\\#[G,G]$ is even, $G!$ is entirely contained in $[G,G]$, and otherwise contained in the coset corresponding to $a$. \nThe reason this bound seems tight is that it's generally easy to get elements in the commutator group (up to the element of order 2): if $a,b,a^{-1},b^{-1}$ are distinct, $[a,b] \\in G!$ by putting every other element of $G$ right next to it's inverse except for $a^{\\pm1}, b^{\\pm1}$ and likewise for products of commutators and so on. \nIs it always the case that $G!$ is a coset of the commutator group?

Are there simple conditions we can impose on $p$ that guarantee that $f, g$ have integer coefficients?", "output": "There is the following result of Davenport, Lewis, and Schinzel [DLS64, Cor to Thm 2]:\n\nTheorem. Let $p \\in \\mathbf Z[x]$.

For example, it shows that in 2, we may replace $\\mathbf Z$ by $\\mathbf N$. Because it's short but takes some time to extract from [DLS64], here is their proof, simplified to this special case.\nProof. Implications 1 $\\Rightarrow$ 2 $\\Rightarrow$ 3 are obvious. For 3 $\\Rightarrow$ 1, factor $p$ as\n$$p = c \\cdot p_1^{e_1} \\cdots p_r^{e_r}$$\nwith $p_j \\in \\mathbf Z[x]$ pairwise coprime primitive irreducible and $c \\in \\mathbf Q$. We only need to treat the odd $e_j$ (and the constant $c$). Let $P = p_1 \\cdots p_r$ be the radical of $p/c$, and choose $d \\in \\mathbf N$ such that $P$ is separable modulo every prime $q \\not\\mid d$. Suppose $P$ has a root modulo $q > 2d\\operatorname{height}(c)$; say\n$$P(n) \\equiv 0 \\pmod q$$\nfor some $n$. Then $P'(n) \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod q$, hence $P(n+q) \\not\\equiv P(n) \\pmod{q^2}$. Replacing $n$ by $n+q$ if necessary, we see that $v_q(P(n)) = 1$; i.e. there is a $j$ such that\n$$v_q\\big(p_i(n)\\big) = \\begin{cases}1, & i = j, \\\\ 0, & i \\neq j.\\end{cases}.$$\nIf $e_j$ is odd, then so is $v_q(p(n))$, which equals $v_q(p(n'))$ for all $n' \\equiv n \\pmod{q^2}$. By assumption 3 we can choose $n' \\equiv n \\pmod{q^2}$ such that $p(n')$ is a sum of squares, so we conclude that $q \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. If $L = \\mathbf Q[x]/(p_j)$, then we conclude that all primes $q > 2d\\operatorname{height}(c)$ that have a factor $\\mathfrak q \\subseteq \\mathcal O_L$ with $e(\\mathfrak q) = f(\\mathfrak q) = 1$ (i.e. $p_j$ has a root modulo $q$) are $1$ mod $4$. By Bauer's theorem (see e.g. [Neu99, Prop. VII.13.9]), this forces $\\mathbf Q(i) \\subseteq L$.\nThus we can write $i = f(\\theta_j)$ for some $f \\in \\mathbf Q[x]$, where $\\theta_j$ is a root of $p_j$. Then $p_j$ divides\n$$N_{\\mathbf Q(i)[x]/\\mathbf Q[x]}\\big(f(x)-i\\big) = \\big(f(x)-i\\big)\\big(f(x)+i\\big),$$\nsince $p_j$ is irreducible and $\\theta_j$ is a zero of both. Since $f(x)-i$ and $f(x)+i$ are coprime and $p_j$ is irreducible, there is a factor $g \\in \\mathbf Q(i)[x]$ of $f(x)+i$ such that\n$$p_j = u \\cdot N_{\\mathbf Q(i)[x]/\\mathbf Q[x]}(g) = u \\cdot g \\cdot \\bar g$$\nfor some $u \\in \\mathbf Q[x]^\\times = \\mathbf Q^\\times$. Applying this to all $p_j$ for which $e_j$ is odd, we get\n$$p = a \\cdot N_{\\mathbf Q(i)[x]/\\mathbf Q[x]}(h)$$\nfor some $h \\in \\mathbf Q(i)[x]$ and some $a \\in \\mathbf Q^\\times$. By assumption 3, this forces $a$ to be a norm as well, so we may assume $a = 1$. Write $h = \\alpha H$ for $\\alpha \\in \\mathbf Q(i)$ and $H \\in \\mathbf Z[i][x]$ primitive. Then\n$$p(x) = |\\alpha|^2 H \\bar H,$$\nso Gauss's lemma gives $|\\alpha|^2 \\in \\mathbf Z$. Since $|\\alpha|^2$ is a sum of rational squares, it is a sum of integer squares; say $|\\alpha|^2 = |\\beta|^2$ for somce $\\beta \\in \\mathbf Z[i]$. Finally, setting\n$$F + iG = \\beta H,$$\nwe get $p = F^2 + G^2$ with $F, G \\in \\mathbf Z[x]$. $\\square$\n\nFootnote: I am certainly surprised by this, given that the version for four squares is clearly false. Indeed, the condition just reads $p(n) \\geq 0$ for all $n \\in \\mathbf Z$. But the OP's example cannot be written as any finite sum of squares in $\\mathbf Z[x]$, because exactly one of the terms can have positive degree.

{"input": "I begin by saying that while I understand what a triangulated / derived category is pretty well, I know nothing about Higher Algebra stuff and not even $\\infty$-categories.\nI've heard some people say that stable $\\infty$-categories are a \"more natural\" point of view to derived categories. Can anyone explain in simple terms (given my background) to me why this is so?\nI study algebraic and arithmetic geometry but all possible motivations are welcome.", "output": "I already answered some version of this question in this answer, but let me try to expand a bit on the concrete advantages in mathematical practice. For understanding the following you need to take on faith that \u221e-categories exist and have roughly the same properties as ordinary categories (which in fact are just a special example of \u221e-categories).\n\nThe derived $\\infty$-category of a scheme\nOne of the biggest advantages of stable \u221e-categories compared to triangulated categories is that they work well in families. This already should be appealing to an algebraic geometer. But it turns out that this makes constructing stable \u221e-categories easier than triangulated categories (contrary to what you might be expecting). For example let me sketch a construction of the symmetric monoidal \u221e-category of a scheme (you can easily adapt it to algebraic spaces/stacks etc..)\nFirst you need to do the affine case: the derived category of a ring. There are many ways of doing it. The most concrete is probably taking the 1-category of chain complexes and inverting quasi-isomorphisms (in the \u221e-categorical sense)\n$$\\mathscr{D}(R):=\\operatorname{Ch}(R)[q.iso^{-1}]$$\nThen you need to prove that it is functorial, symmetric monoidal etc. I personally favour another (equivalent) definition, which uses more technology but it makes all properties follow formally. I am taking as the definition of the derived \u221e-category the stabilization of the animation of the category of finitely generated projective $R$-modules\n$$\\mathscr{D}(R):=\\operatorname{Sp}(\\mathcal{P}_\\Sigma(\\operatorname{Proj}_R))\\,.$$\nThen $\\mathscr{D}(R)$ has all the properties we want because $\\operatorname{Proj}_R$ does. Moreover you can still show easily that $\\mathscr{D}(R)$ is localization of the category of chain complexes at quasi-isomorphisms by using a clever trick, so you lost nothing in concreteness.\nOur next step is to show that $\\mathscr{D}(-)$ as a functor on affine schemes satisfies Zariski descent. Concretely it boils down to showing that the following square of stable \u221e-categories is cartesian\n$$\\require{AMScd} \\begin{CD} \\mathscr{D}(R) @>>> \\mathscr{D}(R[1/f])\\\\\n                              @VVV  @VVV\\\\\n                             \\mathscr{D}(R[1/g]) @>>> \\mathscr{D}(R[1/fg])\\end{CD}$$\nand you can prove this is true again because it is true for $\\operatorname{Proj}_R$ (where it is elementary).\nNOTE THAT THIS IS FALSE FOR THE CORRESPONDING TRIANGULATED CATEGORIES\nThis is one of the amazing advantages of stable \u221e-categories compared to triangulated categories: you can glue their objects. Using this now it is clear how to define the derived $\\infty$-category of a scheme $X$\n$$\\mathscr{D}(X)=\\lim_{\\operatorname{Spec}R\\subseteq X} \\mathscr{D}(R)$$\nwhere the limit is taken over the poset of open affine subsets of $X$. That is, we're saying that an object of $\\mathscr{D}(X)$ is just the collection of an object of $\\mathscr{D}(R)$ for each open affine subscheme plus suitable gluing data. Now by formal properties of limits this is automatically a symmetric monoidal $\\infty$-category: we can take tensor products of elements in $\\mathscr{D}(X)$ by taking them in any affine open and gluing back the resulting objects. If all you have are triangulated categories, constructing the symmetric monoidal structure on $h\\mathscr{D}(X)$ is highly non-trivial.\n\nStability is a property\nOne great advantage of stable $\\infty$-categories is that stability is a property, not a structure. To construct a triangulated category it's not enough to construct the category: you also have to come up with a shift functor, and a family of exact triangles etc. In stable \u221e-categories you don't have to worry about that: you just construct a certain \u221e-category and then check that, say the (canonically defined) functor $\\Omega$ is an equivalence. This has advantages because for example it's clear what should be a stable symmetric monoidal \u221e-category: it's just a symmetric monoidal \u221e-category which is stable and such that the tensor product is exact in each variable. Try instead to come up with the notion of symmetric monoidal triangulated category. I strongly suspect you would not come up with all the required axioms (there is a compatibility between the shift and the tensor product which has some tricky signs).\n\nHomotopy (co)limits\nTriangulated categories rarely have colimits. They have direct sums and usually little more. Stable \u221e-categories instead have all finite limits and colimits (and most of those you'll encounter in practice have all small limits and colimits). This gives you a huge flexibility in working in them. For example you can say that you can reconstruct the sheaves (say on a space $X$) from a sheaf on a neighborhood of a closed subset of $Z$ and a sheaf on the complement, plus some gluing data. This is classical for sheaves of abelian groups, but it gets tricky (although not impossible) to state for derived categories of sheaves. For derived \u221e-categories, however, the same statement as for sheaves of abelian groups work, with the same proof.\n\nAlgebraic K-theory\nA powerful motivation for me is that you cannot define the higher algebraic K-theory of a triangulated category. There are stable \u221e-categories that have the same underlying triangulated category but not the same higher algebraic K-theory. As a person that finds algebraic K-theory very interesting, this would be enough for me to not want to work with triangulated categories altogether\n\nSheaves\nYou can actually have sheaves with values in an \u221e-category. It makes perfect sense, say, to say that algebraic K-theory gives you a Zariski (or Nisnevich) sheaf of spectra on the category of schemes. This ended up allowing wonderful computations that would have been hard to do without stable \u221e-categories. Perhaps not impossible, but most of the older work in the same vein used secretly something like dg-categories which has many of the same features (although not the same versatility), and in any case not triangulated categories.", "meta": {"post_id": 394054, "input_score": 26, "output_score": 47, "post_title": "Why stable $\\infty$-categories?"}}

other physical quantities, like length, time, temperature, etc.\nDenote the corresponding one-dimensional vector spaces by $L$, $T$, etc.\nWhen you multiply (say) some mass $m\u2208M$ and some length $l\u2208L$,\nthe result is $m\u2297l\u2208M\u2297L$.\nHere $M\u2297L$ is another one-dimensional real vector space,\nwhich is capable of \u201cstoring\u201d physical quantities of dimension mass times

of the two half-rays in $M\u2216\\{0\\}$ to be positive,\nand denote it by $M_{>0}$.\nThis makes perfect sense for physical quantities like mass, length, temperature.\nOnce you have an orientation on

{"input": "This semester, I teach a graduate course in epistemology of mathematics and as a case study, I assigned students a discussion on the epistemological status of Fermat's Last Theorem according to different epistemological point of views. One of the hard-line stances we discussed in the course was the one which considers an assertion as being a mathematical theorem only if it comes with a completely rigorous proof.\nIn 1990 and 1995, the papers On modular representations of $\\operatorname{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbb Q}/\\mathbb Q)$ arising from modular forms, Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem and Ring-theoretic properties of certain Hecke algebras by K.Ribet, A.Wiles and R.Taylor and A.Wiles respectively were published. Presupposing previous mathematical knowledge, they form a complete proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.\nMy question is the following:\n\nAre there any mistakes in these 3 papers of some mathematical significance?\n\nOf course, it might be hard ot judge what is of significance, so let me mention a couple of things which I believe are not significant.\n\nTypographical errors are not significant, even if they alter the mathematical content (so if it is written $r\\leq s$ while the proof shows $s\\leq r$, that is not significant).\nReference mistakes are not significant (so if there is a sentence like \"by lemma 12.8 of [6], we conclude\" and lemma 12.8 of [6] allows no such conclusion, but it is easy to see that lemma 4.2 of [11] would do equally well, then that is not significant).\nFor the same reason, I will not count an easily filled incomplete argument as significant, even if strictly faulty (so for instance if there is a sentence like \"X is a cosy zip, and every cosy zip is a zap, therefore X is a zap\" and in fact it is not true that every cosy zip is a zap, but it is true and equally well-known that every strongly cosy zip is a zap and it easy to check that X is a strongly cosy zip, I won't consider this significant).\n\nI would count as significant anything that requires more than a few sentences of essentially novel content (compared to the content provided). If for instance, it is claimed that a certain $x$ can be of 3 different types, each of which satisfy property P, so $x$ satisfies P, but it turns out that $x$ can be of a fourth type. Then, I would count this as a significant mistake even if $x$ satisfies P in this fourth case as well, but for reasons different from the first three cases. In particular, an error does not need to threaten the complete proof nor even the local part it is contained in to be considered significant.\nBasically, I'm thinking of a standard much below what formal certification of the proof would require, but still quite stringent. I think that most authors and referees typically do not achieve that standard in most published papers, though some regularly do even in proofs of deep and hard theorems (I think it is believed that Serre achieved it throughout his career with very few exceptions).\n\nWith such a standard, are there known mistakes in these 3 papers?", "output": "No there are not any mistakes in these papers of any interest. In the 1990s there were a bazillion study groups and seminars across the world devoted to these papers; I personally read all three of the papers you cite, back in the days when I was young and an expert in this area, and they all looked fine to me, and they all looked fine to all the people who were at the IAS with me in 1995 reading them including a whole bunch of people who were a whole lot smarter than me.\nAs has been pointed out the proof of FLT relies on a whole lot more stuff than just those papers, for example Langlands--Tunnell (which I have not read, and suspect I will never read, but which has been generalised out the park by other authors) and Mazur (which I read through once but which others have read through many many times; it's the kind of paper that some people get addicted to and spend many years devoted to). The full Wiles paper uses Deligne's construction of Galois representations associated to higher weight modular forms, because it proves more than FLT (e.g. it proves R=T for some Hida families) and I've also not read Deligne's construction, but I know people who I trust and who have (e.g. Brian Conrad).\nSome comments which might be of interest to you:\n\nI was a post-doc in Berkeley in the mid-90s and during that time I read Ribet's paper; occasionally I would find stuff which I couldn't quite follow, so I would knock on Ken's door and ask him about it, and together we would figure out what he meant. A mathematician would not call these mistakes; one could argue that sometimes there were explanations omitted which you have to be an expert to reconstruct, but I think that this is true of many many papers. In particular a mathematician would not call these \"mistakes\".\n\nWiles uses Gross' results on companion forms, which at the time were not unconditionally proved; Gross' arguments assumed that two \"canonically\"-defined Hecke operators acting on \"canonically\" isomorphic cohomology groups coincided; at the time nobody had any doubt that this result was correct, but there was no published proof in the literature, and indeed it looked at the time that it might be hard to check. By 1995 Taylor had discovered a workaround which avoided Gross' work so the experts knew that there was not a problem here. The fact that the Hecke operators did actually coincide was ultimately verified by a student of Conrad in the early 2000s.\n\nWiles uses etale cohomology in some places, and at the time there was a lot of noise generated by logicians about whether this meant that he had assumed Grothendieck's universe axiom, which was known to be something which one could not prove within ZFC (indeed it was known to the logicians that in theory ZFC could be consistent but that ZFC+Grothendieck's universe axiom could be inconsistent). However Deligne's SGA4.5 had, years before the FLT proof, shown that the theory of etale cohomology could be developed within ZFC.", "meta": {"post_id": 408928, "input_score": 26, "output_score": 46, "post_title": "Are there mistakes in the proof of FLT?"}}

{"input": "I've been wondering for a while: how should mathematicians read an article in order to \"take most\" from it?\nFor example, when I did my Master's thesis I based it on an article (I'm into analysis) and of course I analyzed every and each part of it, extending some results in there and filling some gaps that were \"left to the reader\" I guess, or were thought to be sufficiently trivial by the authors.\nNow I'm doing my phd and I have to choose a specific topic (more or less I have an idea but I haven't exactly set up my mind yet). The fact is I've had to look up some articles to get some ideas and possible topics of research, and by now and I quickly understood that reading and trying to understand the whole thing is impossible. I mean they often have like 60+ articles/books in the bibliography, so I mainly read the introduction and the results, skipping proofs entirely (or almost entirely). Basically what I try to do is to get an idea of the general path taken by the authors, skipping all the technicalities are ok and noting on the side the techniques/results mentioned that I don't know about. Then I quickly look up on the internet what the idea of these techniques is, and that's it. Obviously, a couple of days pass and most of it is gone, except maybe the very very general idea/result it obtained (but only if it isn't too technical).\nI mean it seems a bit shallow, but I can't come up with with better ways to read them, they are so stuffed I really can't keep up. So how would a professional mathematician read an article about a topic he's interested in without going crazy, trying to learn most from it? Maybe in n years from now if one continues this path one can expect to be so well-versed in a very specific topic so that research articles about it become way easier to read?", "output": "Before you decide how to read a particular paper, you have to decide why you're reading that particular paper.\nYou said you're doing your Ph.D. You might want to take a look at a couple of other MO questions, such as When is one 'ready' to make original contributions to mathematics? and On starting graduate school and common pitfalls... and How to escape the inclination to be a universalist or: How to learn to stop worrying and do some research. If the reason you're reading these papers is that you think you have to absorb an infinite amount of mathematical knowledge before you can start doing research, then the first thing you need to do is: Stop thinking that.\nOne reason for reading a paper is that you have a specific research problem that you are trying to solve, and you believe that the paper contains a technique that will help you solve your problem.  In such a situation, you should be constantly thinking, \"Does this technique in fact help me solve my problem, and if so, how does the proof work?\" If you determine that the paper does not help you solve your problem, I'd recommend abandoning ship, especially at this stage of your career.  Your time is precious, and although mastering the techniques of the paper might come in handy one day, you have bigger fish to fry at the moment. On the other hand, if the paper does seem to solve your problem, then don't be afraid to sink a lot of time into it to understand it thoroughly.  If some argument is logically needed for the proof of your own result, then you need to understand it completely, even if you end up just citing the other paper without reproducing the argument in your own paper.\nAnother reason for reading a paper is to increase your general store of mathematical knowledge.  This is a laudable goal, but again, your time is precious. You first need to triage to decide how much effort to invest.\n\nOption 0 is not to read it at all. This is what you will decide to do with most papers, because there are too many papers out there to even read the abstracts of all of them. If a paper is too far from your own area of work and looks like it will require significant effort to absorb, then drop it and move on.\n\nOption 1 is to read just enough to get a general sense of what it is about, so that when you later run into a situation where you might need it, a bell will ring in your head (\"Someone has done some relevant work on this\") and you can return to the paper later.  The important thing here is that even though you're not spending a lot of time on the paper, you should make some effort to put at least a \"stub\" of the paper in your long-term memory, so that when the occasion arises, the memory of this paper will be triggered.  How you do this is up to you; maybe you can keep a log of some sort in which you write short notes to yourself about various papers you read, and re-read the log periodically to refresh your memory.\n\nOption 2 is to read the paper more seriously, to understand in some detail what the results are, but stopping short of completely mastering the proofs.  This is the sort of reading one tends to do when you're looking around for a new topic to work on, and think that this paper might be something you'll jump into and do research on yourself.  You'll need to keep asking yourself, \"Am I really going to work on this topic?\" If you decide that the answer is no, then you should go to Option 1.  If you decide that the answer is yes, then you may wish to proceed to Option 3 below.\n\nOption 3 is to study the paper in full detail and master it. As I mentioned above, you should generally do this only when you're sure that understanding the proofs is needed to do your own research.\n\n\nIn short, the key is to triage, triage, triage.  Decide as soon as you can why you are reading the paper and whether it is meeting your needs.

{"input": "Condensed mathematics is the (potential) unification of various mathematical subfields, including topology, geometry, and number theory. It asserts that analogs in the individual fields are instead different expressions of the same concepts (similarly to the way in which different human languages can express the same thing). -wiki\n\nPreviously, I learned that category theory is said to be the unifying idea of mathematics which is based on noting that generally the act of studying a mathematical object is equivalent to studying its relation with all other objects in the category of that mathematical object. So, what exactly is the idea in condensed mathematics which helps us unify mathematics beyond how we do it in category theory?\n\nRelated question on MathSE", "output": "I don't pretend to have anything more than a superficial understanding of condensed mathematics, but Scholze's lecture notes (on condensed mathematics and analytic geometry) are so clearly written that you can get some sense of the main idea just from studying the first few pages.\nThe starting point is the observation that the traditional way of endowing something with both a topology and an algebraic structure has some shortcomings.  The simplest example is that topological abelian groups do not form an abelian category.  We know from long experience with category theory that an excellent indication of whether you have a \"good\" definition of an object is that the category of all your objects (and the maps between them) has nice properties, and topological abelian groups fail to have some of those nice properties.  In condensed mathematics, the category of topological abelian groups is replaced by the category of condensed abelian groups, which is an abelian category.\nAlthough the goal is easy enough to state and motivate, the method of achieving it was initially not obvious even to Scholze, one of the architects (along with Clausen) of condensed mathematics.  A key role is played by a category that might seem unpromising at first glance: the category $\\mathcal{S}$ of profinite sets, a.k.a. totally disconnected compact Hausdorff spaces (or Stone spaces), with finite jointly surjective families of maps as covers.  Most people's first impression of totally disconnected spaces is that they're weird, and they have some trouble even thinking of examples other than the discrete topology.  However, categorically speaking, $\\mathcal{S}$ has some nice properties.  A condensed abelian group, roughly speaking, a special kind of (contravariant) functor from $\\mathcal{S}$ to the category of abelian groups (somewhat more precisely, it is a sheaf of abelian groups on $\\mathcal{S}$).  That is, the way a topological structure is imposed on abelian groups is not in the classical way (i.e., by taking a set and defining a group operation and a topology on it in isolation), but by taking certain functors from this funny-looking topological category $\\mathcal{S}$ to your algebraic category.\nThere's nothing about this story that is peculiar to abelian groups; by replacing \"abelian group\" with \"set\" or \"ring\" you get condensed sets and condensed rings and so forth.\nThe benefit of this shift from classical structures to condensed structures is not just aesthetic.  One of the nicest applications is that it leads to new proofs of certain classical results in algebraic geometry.  A longstanding puzzle (if you want to call it that) is that certain theorems about complex varieties that \"feel algebraic\" seem to be provable only via \"transcendental methods\"; i.e., by invoking analysis in a seemingly essential way.  Condensed mathematics provides new proofs of some of these classical theorems that are more algebraic.

We expect $b_k$ to have magnitude $M$ when $k \\sim M$, so it is natural to introduce a rescaling\n$$ b_k = 2M f_M(\\frac{k}{2M})$$\nthen we have the initial condition $f_M(1 + \\frac{1}{2M})=1$, and for $k = 2Mt$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ a multiple of $\\frac{1}{2M}$ we then have after a short calculation\n$$ \\frac{f_M(t+\\frac{1}{2M}) - f_M(t)}{1/2M} = - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{f_M(t+\\frac{1}{2M})}{t} \\right\\rfloor.$$\nFormally passing to the limit $M \\to \\infty$, we thus expect $f_M$ to converge in some suitable sense to a continuous, piecewise differentiable function $f: [0,1] \\to {\\bf R}$ with $f(1)=1$ that solves the ODE\n$$ f'(t) = - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{f(t)}{t} \\right\\rfloor$$\nfor all $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$.\n(To make this rigorous, one can for instance rewrite both the difference equation and the presumed limiting ODE as partial sum equations and integral equations respectively to improve the stability, and then apply a compactness theorem such as the Arzela-Ascoli theorem to conclude, in the spirit of constructing various mild or weak solutions in PDE.)  One can intuitively think of the graph of $f$ as the trajectory of a light ray passing through different media that travels in straight lines until it hits one of the flat boundaries $f(t)=t$, $f(t)=2t$, $f(t)=3t$, etc., at which point it \"refracts\" to a different slope. (A numerical plot of the graphs of $f$ and $f_M$ for some reasonably large $M$ would be quite revealing, but I do not have the time to generate these plots at present.)\nOne can solve this ODE explicitly from the initial condition $f(1)=1$ as a continuous piecewise linear function.  If we define the sequence $1 = t_0 > t_1 > t_2 > \\dots$ by the recursion\n$$ t_n = \\frac{2n}{2n+1} t_{n-1}$$\nso that $t_n$ is a partial half-Wallis product\n$$ t_n = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\dots \\cdot \\frac{2n}{2n+1} = \\frac{(n! 2^n)^2}{(2n+1)!}$$\n(which already begins to hint at the emergence of $\\pi$) then one can show by induction that\n$$ f(t) = n t_{n-1} + n(t_{n-1}-t) = (n+1) t_n - n (t-t_n)$$\nfor $t_n \\leq t \\leq t_{n-1}$ and all $n \\geq 1$.  In particular\n$$ f(t_n) = (n+1) t_n.$$\nFrom Stirling's approximation we have for large $n$ that\n$$ t_n = \\frac{(n! 2^n)^2}{(2n+1)!} \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}}.$$\nWe remark that this asymptotic can also be derived from (and is in fact equivalent to) the Wallis product $\\frac{\\pi}{2} = (\\frac{2}{1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}) \\cdot (\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}) \\cdot (\\frac{6}{5} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7}) \\cdot \\dots$ after some routine algebraic manipulation.\nThus if $k \\approx 2M t_n \\approx 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}}$, then\n$$ b_k \\approx 2M f(t_n) \\approx (n+1) 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}}$$\nand hence\n\\begin{align*}\na_k &\\approx k(b_k-M) \\\\\n&\\approx 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}} ((n+1) 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}} - M )\\\\\n&\\approx M^2 (\\pi + O(n^{-1/2})).\n\\end{align*}\nSending $n \\to \\infty$, we morally obtain\n$$ a_1 \\approx M^2 \\pi$$\nas expected.\nIt is likely that a more careful quantitative accounting of error terms can turn the above heuristic analysis into a rigorous argument, but I leave this to the interested reader.\nWe remark also that this recurrence can be used to give a (quite inefficient) algorithm for computing $\\pi$ on a simple adding machine, basically by implementing the Wallis product formula in a rather pedestrian fashion.", "meta": {"post_id": 430690, "input_score": 75, "output_score": 101, "post_title": "A number theory problem where pi appears surprisingly"}}

Can anyone point me to any?", "output": "It's a bit of a long story, but I can at least give the idea.  Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\\mathbb{C}$.  The Hodge conjecture says that for all $p\\geq 0$, the cycle class map\n$$Ch^p(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\to Hdg^p(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}}$$\nfrom codimension p algebraic cycles to Hodge classes is surjective, with rational coefficients.  First, a small modification: Grothendieck gave a Chern character isomorphism\n$$K_0(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\simeq \\oplus_p Ch^p(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}}$$\nidentifying rational Chow theory with rational algebraic K-theory, so the Hodge conjecture can be equivalently reformulated as saying that the map\n$$K_0(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\to \\oplus_p Hdg^p(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}}$$\nis surjective.  Now, the proposed modification involves modifying $K_0(X)$ to a different kind of K-theory $K^{an}_0(X)$, which takes into account the analytic nature of $\\mathbb{C}$.  I will describe more precisely what this analytic K-theory is below, but for now let me take it as a black box.  The usual K-theory maps to the analytic K-theory, and the above map extends to a map\n$$K^{an}_0(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\to \\oplus_p Hdg^p(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}}.$$\nThen the weak form of the modified Hodge conjecture is that this map is surjective.  This modified form is obviously strictly weaker than the usual Hodge conjecture.  But it admits a strengthening, in a different direction.  Recall that the usual cycle class map from $Ch^p(X)$ to $Hdg^p(X)$ actually factors through a more refined target, the Deligne cohomology group $H^{2p}(X;\\mathbb{Z}(p))$, which is an extension of $Hdg^p(X)$ by the Griffiths intermediate Jacobian.  (This Deligne cohomology is essentially the \"derived\" version of the definition of Hodge classes.)  Now, it is known that the Hodge conjecture fails on the level of Deligne cohomology, and in fact this obstructs some inductive methods for trying to prove the Hodge conjecture by induction on dimension and using hyperplane sections (see section 3 of http://publications.ias.edu/sites/default/files/hodge.pdf).  However, the situation conjecturally improves when passing to analytic K-theory.  Just as with the usual cycle class map to Hodge cycles, the refined cycle class map to Deligne cohomology also extends to a map from analytic K-theory\n$$K^{an}_0(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\to \\oplus_p H^{2p}(X;\\mathbb{Q}(p)),$$\nand we conjecture this map to be not just surjective, but an isomorphism.  In fact, one can also make an analogous map out of $K^{an}_i(X)_{\\mathbb{Q}}$ for any $i\\in\\mathbb{Z}$, with values in $\\oplus_p H^{2p-i}(X;\\mathbb{Q}(p))$, and we even conjecture this to be an isomorphism for all $i$.\nTo finish I want to say something about what this analytic K-theory is, but first, a sobering remark: one of the reasons people really care about the Hodge conjecture is that it produces strong algebraic data (algebraic cycles) out of rather weak topological/analytic data (Hodge classes).  The modified Hodge conjecture does not do this: it produces analytic data instead of algebraic data.  But it maybe gives a new perspective on the Hodge conjecture: if the modified Hodge conjecture is true, then the usual Hodge conjecture would essentially amount to the statement that the comparison map $K_0(X) \\to K^{an}_0(X)$ is surjective on connected components, i.e. any analytic K-theory class can be continuously deformed into an algebraic K-theory class.  Moreover, the modified conjecture fits the spirit of the original Hodge conjecture, in the following sense: cycle classes, or algebraic $K_0$ classes, can be viewed as a kind of universal source for cohomology classes, and the Hodge conjecture is saying that Hodge classes give universal classes.  Similarly, the modified Hodge conjecture is saying is that, in some sense, Deligne cohomology is a universal cohomology theory for analytic spaces over the complex numbers.  So we're not \"missing\" any cohomology theories; Hodge theory really has it all.  This is actually why I'm interested in the statement, not because it's connected to the traditional Hodge conjecture.  I just want to see if we're missing something.  If we are missing something, then the modified Hodge conjecture will be wrong, and analytic K-theory will hopefully hint to us exactly what it is that we're missing.\nNow, about the definition of analytic K-theory.  It fits into the framework of Alexander Efimov's remarkable extension of the scope of algebraic K-theory.  Usually, algebraic K-theory is defined in terms of small categories, like the category of vector bundles.  Efimov says that this is a mistake, and we should think of it as an invariant of large categories, like the category of quasicoherent sheaves.  (Actually, one needs to work with the derived analogs of these, namely perfect complexes and derived quasi-coherent sheaves, but let me slough over this point for the purposes of this already too lengthy explanation...)  Now, this seems like an academic distinction, because the small and large categories determine each other, via passing to Ind-objects in one direction and compact objects in the other.  But the point is that there are large categories which are not Ind-categories of small categories, but for which algebraic K-theory can still, magically, be defined, and with basically all the same formal properties as in the more restrictive classical context.  These are the so-called dualizable categories studied by Lurie.  It turns out these things are everywhere once you know to look for them, and I think it's important to get very comfortable with these non-compactly generated beasts...\nAnyway, there is such a dualizable, non-compactly generated category of topological $\\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces, let's call it $Mod^{an}(\\mathbb{C})$ (formally it is a certain full subcategory of derived condensed $\\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces), and we can build a theory of (derived) quasicoherent sheaves on $X$ where all the underlying vector spaces are objects of $Mod^{an}(\\mathbb{C})$ instead of usual (smaller) category of abstract $\\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces.  We take Efimov's K-theory of this quasicoherent sheaf category and call it $K^{an}(X)$.  The last thing to explain is what this category $Mod^{an}(\\mathbb{C})$ is. It turns out that it can be described from a classical functional analysis perspective: its basic objects (which generate everything under colimits inside derived condensed $\\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces) are the sequential colimits of (say) Hilbert spaces along injective transition maps which are compact operators, with singular values decaying rapidly.  This is a somewhat obscure class of dual Frechet spaces, but it really is completely forced on us by the abstract considerations of Efimov's theory, and I don't believe there's any other choice than this precise one which should work.\nTo sum up, we replace usual vector bundles by some more nebulous analytic beasts described using functional analysis, and the hope is that this change makes K-theory match the most refined cohomology theory coming from Hodge theory.", "meta": {"post_id": 446978, "input_score": 38, "output_score": 62, "post_title": "Clausen's modified Hodge Conjecture"}}
{"input": "I am currently working on a proof that would need to use the following theorem that I cannot prove:\n\"Let $A$ be a finite set of positive real numbers. Then, the set $A + A - A$ contains at least as many positive elements as negative elements. ($0$ is counted as a positive element)\"\nTo clarify: The set $A + A - A$ is defined as $\\{a_1 + a_2 - a_3\\mid a_1, a_2, a_3 \\in A \\}$.\nFor example: If $A = \\{2,5\\}$. Then $A+A-A = \\{-1, 2, 5, 8\\}$.\nThe nature of this problem lies in the duplicates that can occur. Intuitively I think that the theorem should be true since we add an element of $A$ two times but subtract an element only one time. However, it seems to me that it is very hard to prove.\nHere is the idea I have been working on so far (which might be the wrong way to go about this):\nLet $A = \\{a_1, a_2,\\dotsc,a_n\\}$. We first look at the set $A-A$. This set is symmetric around zero. For every element $x$ in $A-A$, $-x$ also occurs in $A-A$. This means that for every negative element, there also exists a unique positive element.\nNext we look at the set $a_1 + A - A$. This just shifts $A-A$ to the right. Some negative elements might change into positive ones, but we do not care about that. What is important is, that every positive element stays positive. Therefore again, this set contains more or equally as many positive than negative elements.\nMy next idea is to look at the set $a_2 + A - A$ and take the union with the set $a_1 + A - A$. I want to do this with every $a_i$. That means in the end I take the following union: $\\bigcup\\limits_{i=1}^{n}a_i + A - A$ which is exactly $ A+A-A$.\nI want to prove at each step that there are still more or equally as many positive than negative elements in the current union of sets. My idea to do this is to think of the following: Since $A-A$ is symmetric around $0$, I can split $A-A$ into elements that are $>0$ and elements that are $<0$ (we do not care about the $0$). These two subsets have the same size. If we add an $a_i$ to a positive element, we have two cases:\n\nCase: We get a new element that does not already occur in our union of sets.\nIn this case we do not have to do anything.\n\nCase: We get a duplicate. In this case we need to show that we also get a unique duplicate if we add $a_i$ to a certain negative element.\n\n\nMy method for the second case was: If $a_i + x_1 = y$ and $y$ is a duplicate, then there exists an $a_j$ such that $a_j + x_2 = y$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ are contained in the set $A - A$, we know that $-x_1$ and $-x_2$ are also contained in the set $A - A$. Now we see that $a_i + (-x_2)$ also produces a duplicate that originates from the negative number $-x_2$, since $a_i + (-x_2) = a_j + (-x_1)$.\nThis method does actually always find a negative duplicate, however it is not unique in very specific cases. It is possible that two different positive duplicates refer to the same negative duplicate.\nExample (a real example would be too big, so assume that $A$ contains $3$, $4$ and $6$ and assume that $A - A$ contains $4$, $5$ and $7$ and therefore also $-4$, $-5$, and $-7$):\n\n$4 + A - A$ contains $4 + 4 = 8$ (and $4 + (-5) = -1$)\n\n$6 + A - A$ contains $6 + 4 = 10$ (and $6 + (-7) = -1$)\n\n$3 + A - A$ contains $3 + 5 = 8$ and $3 + 7 = 10$. Both of these duplicates refer to the same negative duplicate $3 + (-4) = -1$.\n\n\nAlthough this case is very specific, it kind of destroys my whole proof unfortunately.\nIf somebody has an idea for this problem, maybe even with a completely different method, I would be very grateful to hear and also very excited to discuss it.\nOn a side note: For my project, it would suffice to show that\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{@{}c@{}}\n\\text{Number of positive}\\\\\n\\text{elements in $A + A - A$}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\n\\geq c\\cdot\n\\left(\\begin{array}{@{}c@{}}\n\\text{Number of elements}\\\\\n\\text{in $A + A - A$}\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $c>0$  does not depend on $A$.

There are many constructions; here is just one. We first observe if $p$ is a large prime then we can achieve this claim with $N=p$ and $\\varepsilon = 1-2/p$ by a probabilistic construction, namely by selecting $A$ to consist of one element at random for each of the $\\lfloor \\frac{p}{3}\\rfloor$ pairs $\\{ 3j, 3j+1\\}$ for $0 \\leq j < \\frac{p-2}{3}$.  $A-A$ will surely avoid $\\pm 1$, whilst $A+A$ will equal all of ${\\bf Z}/p{\\bf Z}$ with exponentially high probability by a standard union bound argument.\nTaking Cartesian products of these examples and using the Chinese remainder theorem, one can achieve the claim for $\\varepsilon = \\prod_{k=1}^K (1-\\frac{2}{p_k})$ for any sequence $p_1,\\dots,p_K$ of sufficiently large distinct primes.

If we take\n$$ A'' := A' \\cup \\{ 10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\}$$\nthen $|A''| = O(\\varepsilon N)$, and $A''+A''-A''$ contains the set\n$$ A'+A' - \\{10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\}$$\nwhich has cardinality at least $5N$ and consists entirely of negative numbers.  On the other hand, the positive elements of $A''+A''-A''$ are contained in the union of $\\{1,\\dots,4N\\}$, the set\n$$ \\{10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\} + A'-A',$$\nthe set\n$$ \\{10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\} + \\{10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\} - A''$$\nand the set\n$$ \\{10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\} + A'' - \\{10N, 20N, 30N, 40N, 50N \\},$$\nand hence the number of positive elements is at most $4N + O(\\varepsilon N)$.

Moderately complicated objects that appear two or more times in the statement to be justified are particularly prime candidates for being assigned a temporary name.\nAbstract away any information that you suspect to be irrelevant (see item 10 of this blog post of mine for further elaboration of this point).  It's OK if your initial abstraction turns out to fail - the counterexample often gives very instructive clues as to how to utilize the information that you previously believed to be irrelevant.\nMake a guess as to how the justification might proceed, and in particular identify some simpler subclaim that could imply the original claim.  Again, it's OK if your initial guess fails - the failure again will likely provide instructive clues as to what the alternative should be.\nAbove all, try something.  Staring at a problem and declaring that you have no idea how to proceed is what Gowers in this blog post refers to as having a \"fake difficulty\".  As stated in Principles 2 and 3, at this stage of the problem solving process one should not be afraid to make guesses that fail; this is far more productive than not guessing at all. (Nobody is going to administer an electric shock to you if you guess incorrectly.)\n\nNow let's return to Question 1 and apply some of the above principles.  The expression $\\frac{\\omega_1 \\lambda_2(u) I(t) + \\omega_2 \\lambda_4(u) D(t)}{\\omega_1 I(t) + \\omega_2 D(t)}$ shows up twice here, so, following Principle 1, let's give it a name, say $X(u)$:\n$$ X(u) := \\frac{\\omega_1 \\lambda_2(u) I(t) + \\omega_2 \\lambda_4(u) D(t)}{\\omega_1 I(t) + \\omega_2 D(t)}.$$\n(I include a dependence on $u$ here because we will be integrating in $u$, but since we aren't doing anything interesting in the $t$ variable, I am simplifying the notation by dropping the $t$ dependence.)  Also, if one looks at both the inequality to be justified, as well as the definition of $\\Pi$, then the function $x \\mapsto \\log(1+x) - x$ shows up repeatedly, so let's give that a name too:\n$$ f(x) := \\log(1+x)-x.$$\nOur task is now to show that\n$$ \\int_{\\mathcal U} f(X(u))\\ \\nu(du) \\leq \\Pi \\tag{1}$$\nwhere from the article, $\\Pi$ is defined (after concatenating some definitions and using our new function $f$) as\n$$ \\int_{\\mathcal U} f(\\lambda_2(u) \\wedge \\lambda_4(u)) 1_{\\lambda_2(u) \\wedge \\lambda_4(u) > 0} + f(\\lambda_2(u) \\vee \\lambda_4(u)) 1_{\\lambda_2(u) \\vee \\lambda_4(u) \\leq 0}\\ \\nu(du).$$\nComparing both sides of (1) we see that both sides are integrals over the same domain ${\\mathcal U}$ using the same measure $\\nu(du)$.  So, as per Principle 3, we can make a guess that we are supposed to establish a pointwise inequality\n$$ f(X(u)) \\leq f(\\lambda_2(u) \\wedge \\lambda_4(u)) 1_{\\lambda_2(u) \\wedge \\lambda_4(u) > 0} + f(\\lambda_2(u) \\vee \\lambda_4(u)) 1_{\\lambda_2(u) \\vee \\lambda_4(u) \\leq 0}$$\nfor each $u$ separately (as opposed to, say, using some integral identity such as the integration by parts formula).  Let us now make this guess, and simplify the notation further by omitting the $u$ dependence, so we now want to show\n$$ f(X) \\leq f(\\lambda_2 \\wedge \\lambda_4) 1_{\\lambda_2 \\wedge \\lambda_4 > 0} + f(\\lambda_2 \\vee \\lambda_4) 1_{\\lambda_2 \\vee \\lambda_4 \\leq 0}. \\tag{2}$$\nWe again make a guess (Principle 3): this should be justified by combining some property (such as positivity, monotonicity, or convexity) of the function $f$ with some relationship between $X$, $\\lambda_2$, and $\\lambda_4$ (as opposed to exploiting some relationship between $f$ and the arguments $X$, $\\lambda_2 \\wedge \\lambda_4$, $\\lambda_2 \\vee \\lambda_4$).  Let's set $f$ aside for now and take a closer look at $X$.  Invoking Principle 1 again, we temporarily introduce some more notation\n$$ a := \\omega_1 I(t); \\quad b := \\omega_2 D(t)$$\nand now $X$ can be written as\n$$ X = \\frac{a \\lambda_2 + b \\lambda_4}{a+b}.$$\nInvoking Principle 2, we suspect that the only properties of $a$ and $b$ that are likely to be relevant here are that they are positive real numbers.  At this point it should be clear the relationship between $X$, $\\lambda_2$, and $\\lambda_4$: the former quantity is a convex combination of the latter two!  So we are reduced to the task of establishing the inequality (2) whenever $X$ is a convex combination of $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_4$.\nAt this point it is all up to the function $f$.  I recommend that you plot this function (or get some computer algebra package to plot it for you), and try to prove this inequality manually.  Given the presence of the cutoffs $1_{\\lambda_2 \\wedge \\lambda_4 > 0}$ and $1_{\\lambda_2 \\vee \\lambda_4 \\leq 0}$, it will make sense to split into cases depending on the sign of $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_4$, and maybe also to split into cases depending on which of $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_4$ is larger. (One may end up initially splitting up into more cases than is absolutely necessary, but that is OK - the initial justification is often a bit messier than needed, and can always be tidied up later.  At this stage of the problem solving process, it is more important to find an argument that works than to find an argument that is elegant.)\nI'll let you work out your second question on your own using these principles.  Some hints to get you started: as per Principle 1, one can introduce the function\n$$ g(s) := \\psi(s) - \\frac{A}{\\mu_1}.$$\nOne can guess that the $t^{-1}$ factor is going to be cancelled out, so that one is actually trying to prove\n$$ \\int_0^t |g(s)|\\ ds \\leq t^{1/2} (\\int_0^t g(s)^2\\ ds)^{1/2}.$$\nHolder's inequality involves integrals, so the factor $t$ here is presumably going to come from an integral identity such as $t = \\int_0^t 1\\ ds$.
