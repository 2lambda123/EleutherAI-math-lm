{"input": "I am currently reading various differential geometry books. From what I understand differential forms allow us to generalize calculus to manifolds and thus perform integration on manifolds. I gather that it is, in general, completely distinct from Lebesgue measure theory and is more like a generalization of Riemann integration.\nOk so here's the problem. I have always viewed Lebesgue measure theory as 'solving the issues with Riemann integration'. For example, a big problem with Riemann integration  is that the space of Riemann integral functions is not complete. The fact that $L^p$ spaces in the Lebesgue theory are complete seems like a huge improvement on the Riemann situation, and is vital for so many concepts in functional analysis, PDEs, operator theory, and numerical analysis.\nSo if we then consider differential geometry and integration via differential forms, unless I am misunderstanding something, we lose all the benefits of Lebesgue theory?\nIt seems like if do lose all those benefits we are in a very bad situation. For example, how are we supposed to rigorously define solution spaces for PDEs if we can't use $L^p$ spaces and thus can't use Sobolev spaces? How can we obtain acceptable convergence of some sequence that may arise during our work if we are operating in this generalized Riemann setting where we lack completeness?\nIn summary, if differential forms are a generalization of Riemann integration how are we supposed to perform analysis when we no longer have the power and utility of Lebesgue measure theory?", "output": "People use measure theory in tandem with differential forms all the time\u2014there's no contradiction whatsoever between the formalisms. Be aware, though, that the adjective \u201cRiemannian\u201d in the context of differential geometry refers to constructions depending on Riemannian metrics (which are \u201cRiemannian\u201d in the sense of originating in the work of Bernhard Riemann), not to Riemann integration.\nSuppose that $M$ is a smooth $n$-manifold. By definition, it's locally diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^n$, so that you can define a set $S \\subset M$ to be measurable if and only if $x(S \\cap U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ is Lebesgue measurable for every local coordinate chart $x: U \\to x(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$. This gives you a $\\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets on $M$ that correctly completes the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets on $M$ as a topological space. At this point, you have everything you need to define measurable functions, vector fields, differential forms, tensor fields, etc., in a manner compatible with calculations in local coordinates.\nNow, suppose that $M$ is a Riemannian manifold, so that it comes equipped with a Riemannian metric $g$\u2014again, the \u201cRiemannian\u201d here does not refer to Riemann integration, but to Riemann himself and his work on differential geometry. On any local coordinate chart $x : U \\to x(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, you can define a measure $\\lambda_{g,x}$ on $U$ by setting\n$$\n \\lambda_{g,x}(S \\cap U) := \\int_{x(S \\cap U)} \\sqrt{\\det\\left(g\\left(\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i},\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^j}\\right)\\right)} \\,d\\lambda\n$$\nfor any Lebesgue measurable $S \\subset M$, where $\\lambda$ denotes Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. By paracompactness of the manifold $M$, one can cover $M$ by a locally finite open cover of such local coordinate charts, and hence use a smooth partition of unity subordinate to this cover to patch these local scaled pullbacks of Lebesgue measure together into a single measure $\\lambda_g$, the Riemannian measure [!] on $M$ with respect to $g$, which is a complete $\\sigma$-finite measure on the $\\sigma$-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets in $M$.\nLet me now describe the basic properties of $\\lambda_g$.\n\nThe measure $\\lambda_g$ is compatible with calculations in local coordinates, in the precise sense that $\\lambda_g(S \\cap U) = \\lambda_{g,x}(S \\cap U)$ for any Lebesgue measurable $S$ and any local coordinate chart $x : U \\to x(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\nIf $g^\\prime$ is any another Riemannian metric, then the Riemannian measures $\\lambda_g$ and $\\lambda_{g^\\prime}$ will be mutually absolutely continuous $\\sigma$-finite measures with smooth Radon\u2013Nikodym derivative computable directly in terms of $g$ and $g^\\prime$.\n\nSuppose that $M$ is orientable, and let $\\mathrm{vol}_g \\in \\Omega^n(M)$ be the Riemannian volume form defined by $g$. Then for any Riemann integrable $f$ on $M$,\n$$\n \\int_M f \\, \\mathrm{vol}_g = \\int_M f \\,d\\lambda_g,\n$$\nso that $\\lambda_g$ really is the (completed) Radon measure on $M$ corresponding to the positive functional $C_c(M) \\ni f \\mapsto \\int_M f \\, \\mathrm{vol}_g$ via the Riesz representation theorem. In other words, integration with respect to $\\lambda_g$ really is the \u201cLebesgue-ification\u201d of integration against the top-degree form $\\mathrm{vol}_g$.\n\n\nOnce you've constructed the Riemannian measure on your Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, the sky is now the limit\u2014you can construct $L^p$ and Sobolev spaces of functions, vector fields, differential forms, tensor fields, etc., and in particular, you can use them to study, for instance, the geometric partial differential operators (e.g., generalisations of the Laplacian and the Dirac operator) and their associated partial differential equations (e.g., heat equations) to great mathematical effect. As a mathematical researcher, I'm personally most familiar with the mathematical ecosystem centred around the Atiyah\u2013Singer index theorem, which relates quantities from algebraic topology to functional-analytic computations on Riemannian manifolds, but you should be aware, for instance, that Perelman's proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture involved the detailed analysis of a certain highly non-linear PDE for the Riemannian metric itself [!]. Perhaps the most accessible example of these methods in action is Hodge theory, which basically computes the cohomology of a compact manifold in terms of solutions of the Laplace equation (with respect to some Riemannian metric) on differential forms of various degrees.\nP.S. People tend to take the extension of Lebesgue theory from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to manifolds more or less for granted, so precise accounts of this can be oddly hard to find. However, a precise if terse account of Lebesgue theory on manifolds can be found in Dieudonn\u00e9's Treatise of Analysis, Volume 3, Section 16.22 (especially Theorem 16.22.2 and the following discussion). Dieudonn\u00e9 doesn't require a Riemannian metric, but the point is that Riemannian metric gives a canonical choice of Lebesgue measure in the sense of Dieudonn\u00e9, in exactly the same way that it gives a canonical volume form in the orientable case. In fact, Lebesgue measures in the sense of Dieudonn\u00e9 can be identified with nowhere vanishing $1$-densities, and the construction of the Riemannian measure $\\lambda_g$ is really the construction of the canonical $1$-density $\\lvert \\mathrm{vol}_g \\rvert$ associated to $g$.\n\nADDENDUM\nOne can define a measurable $k$-form on $M$ to be a map $\\omega : M \\to \\wedge^k T^\\ast M$, such that the following hold.\n\nFor every $m \\in M$, $\\omega(m) \\in \\wedge^k T^\\ast M_m$ (i.e., $\\omega$ is a set-theoretic section of $\\wedge^k T^\\ast M$).\nFor every local coordinate chart $x : U \\to x(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$, the pullback $(x^{-1})^\\ast \\omega : x(U) \\to \\wedge^k \\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by\n$$\n (x^{-1})^\\ast\\omega := \\sum_{i_1 < \\cdots < i_k} \\omega\\left(\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i_1}},\\dotsc,\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{i_k}}\\right) dx^{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge dx^{i_k}\n$$\n(with the usual abuses of notation) is measurable; this turns out to be equivalent to requiring that $\\omega(X_1,\\dotsc,X_k) : M \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be measurable (in the above sense) for any smooth vector fields $X_1,\\dots,X_k \\in \\mathfrak{X}(M)$.\n\nNow, suppose that $N$ is an oriented $k$-dimensional submanifold of $M$ (compact and without boundary, for simplicity), and let $x : U \\to x(U) \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a local coordinate chart of $M$, such that $x(N \\cap U) = V_{x,N} \\times \\{0\\}$ for some open $V_{x,N} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^k$, and such that restriction of $x$ to a diffeomorphism $N \\cap U \\to V_{x,N}$ is orientation-preserving. Then we can define\n$$\n \\int_{N \\cap U} \\omega := \\int_{V_{x,N}} \\omega\\left(\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{1}},\\dotsc,\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{k}}\\right) d\\lambda_{\\mathbb{R}^k}\n$$\nwhenever the Lebesgue integral on the right-hand side exists (with $\\lambda_{\\mathbb{R}^k}$ the Lebesgue measure on $\\mathbb{R}^k$). We can then define $\\omega$ to be integrable on $N$ whenever it's integrable in this way on $N \\cap U$ for any suitable local coordinate chart $x : U \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, and then, by exactly the same arguments as in the Riemann integral case, patch these local integrals into a global Lebesgue integral $\\int_N \\omega$, which turns out to be independent of all the choices of local coordinate chart and partition of unity made along the way.", "meta": {"id": 2857374, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 2857374, 'input_score': 103, 'output_score': 133, 'post_title': 'Lebesgue measure theory vs differential forms?'}"}}

And is there an actual union of all three out there somewhere I can study (that is in terms of programs and types, not proofs and propositions)? This is in response to comments on the question, not to any current answers.", "output": "First, to reiterate one of cody's points, the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (which Coq's kernel is\nbased on) is very different from the Calculus of Constructions.

This \nis a very different beast than the original CoC, which is\nbest thought of as a dependent version of F-omega. (For instance, CiC \nhas set-theoretic models and the CoC doesn't.) \nThat said, the lambda-cube (of which the CoC is a member) is typically presented as a pure type system for reasons of economy in the number of typing rules. By treating sorts, types, and terms as elements of the same syntactic category, you can write down many fewer rules and your proofs get quite a bit less redundant as well. \nHowever, for understanding, it can be helpful to separate out the different categories explicitly. We can introduce three syntactic categories, kinds (ranged over by the metavariable k), types (ranged over by the metavariable A), and terms (ranged over by the metavariable e). Then all eight systems can be understood as variations on what is permitted at each of the three levels.\n\u03bb\u2192 (Simply-typed lambda calculus)\n k ::= \u2217\n A ::= p | A \u2192 B\n e ::= x | \u03bbx:A.e | e e\n\nThis is the basic typed lambda calculus.

If we add it at the level of types, then we add a new kind k \u2192 k which is the type of type-level functions, and abstraction \u03bba:k.A and application A B at the type level as well. So now we don't have polymorphism, but we do have type operators.\nIf memory serves, this system does not have any more computational power than the STLC; it just gives you the ability to abbreviate types.\n\u03bb2 (System F)\n k ::= \u2217\n A ::= a | p | A \u2192 B  | \u2200a:k. A \n e ::= x | \u03bbx:A.e | e e | \u039ba:k. e | e [A]\n\nInstead of adding type operators, we could have added polymorphism. At the type level, we add \u2200a:k. A which is a polymorphic type former, and at the term level, we add abstraction over types \u039ba:k. e and type application e [A].\nThis system is much more powerful than the STLC -- it is as strong as second-order arithmetic.\n\u03bb\u03c9 (System F-omega)\n k ::= \u2217 | k \u2192 k \n A ::= a | p | A \u2192 B  | \u2200a:k.

B | \u039bx:A.B | A [e]\n e ::= x | \u03bbx:A.e | e e\n\nInstead of polymorphism, we could have gone in the direction of dependency from simply-typed lambda calculus. If you permitted the function type to let its argument be used in the return type (ie, write \u03a0x:A. B(x) instead of A \u2192 B), then you get \u03bbP. To make this really useful, we have to extend the set of kinds with a kind of type operators which take terms as arguments \u03a0x:A. k , and so we have to add a corresponding abstraction \u039bx:A.B and application A [e] at the type level as well. \nThis system is sometimes called LF, or the Edinburgh Logical Framework.\nIt has the same computational strength as the simply-typed lambda calculus.\n\u03bbP2 (no special name)\n k ::= \u2217 | \u03a0x:A. k \n A ::= a | p | \u03a0x:A.

This involves adding a kind \u03a0a:k. k' for type operators, and corresponding type-level abstraction \u039bx:A.B and application A [e]. \nSince there's again no jump in computational strength over the STLC, this system should also make a fine basis for a logical framework, but no one has done it. \n\u03bbP\u03c9 (the Calculus of Constructions)\n k ::= \u2217 | \u03a0x:A. k | \u03a0a:k. k'\n A ::= a | p | \u03a0x:A.

One can intuitively think of the graph of $f$ as the trajectory of a light ray passing through different media that travels in straight lines until it hits one of the flat boundaries $f(t)=t$, $f(t)=2t$, $f(t)=3t$, etc., at which point it \"refracts\" to a different slope. (A numerical plot of the graphs of $f$ and $f_M$ for some reasonably large $M$ would be quite revealing, but I do not have the time to generate these plots at present.)\nOne can solve this ODE explicitly from the initial condition $f(1)=1$ as a continuous piecewise linear function.

In particular\n$$ f(t_n) = (n+1) t_n.$$\nFrom Stirling's approximation we have for large $n$ that\n$$ t_n = \\frac{(n! 2^n)^2}{(2n+1)!} \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}}.$$\nWe remark that this asymptotic can also be derived from (and is in fact equivalent to) the Wallis product $\\frac{\\pi}{2} = (\\frac{2}{1} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}) \\cdot (\\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5}) \\cdot (\\frac{6}{5} \\cdot \\frac{6}{7}) \\cdot \\dots$ after some routine algebraic manipulation.\nThus if $k \\approx 2M t_n \\approx 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}}$, then\n$$ b_k \\approx 2M f(t_n) \\approx (n+1) 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}}$$\nand hence\n\\begin{align*}\na_k &\\approx k(b_k-M) \\\\\n&\\approx 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}} ((n+1) 2M \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2\\sqrt{n}} - M )\\\\\n&\\approx M^2 (\\pi + O(n^{-1/2})).\n\\end{align*}\nSending $n \\to \\infty$, we morally obtain\n$$ a_1 \\approx M^2 \\pi$$\nas expected.\nIt is likely that a more careful quantitative accounting of error terms can turn the above heuristic analysis into a rigorous argument, but I leave this to the interested reader.\nWe remark also that this recurrence can be used to give a (quite inefficient) algorithm for computing $\\pi$ on a simple adding machine, basically by implementing the Wallis product formula in a rather pedestrian fashion.", "meta": {"id": 430690, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 430690, 'input_score': 75, 'output_score': 101, 'post_title': 'A number theory problem where pi appears surprisingly'}"}}

{"input": "In so-called 'natural unit', it is said that physical quantities are measured in the dimension of 'mass'. For example, $\\text{[length]=[mass]}^{-1}$ and so on.\nIn quantum field theory, the dimension of coupling constant is very important because it determines renormalizability of the theory.\nHowever, I do not see what exactly the mathematical meaning of 'physical dimension' is. For example, suppose we have self-interaction terms $g_1\\cdot \\phi\\partial^\\mu \\phi \\partial_\\mu \\phi$ and $g_2 \\cdot \\phi^4$,  where $\\phi$ is a real scalar field, $g_i$ are coupling constants and we assume $4$ dimensional spacetime.\nThen, it is stated in standard physics books that the scalar field is of mass dimension $1$ and so $g_1$ must be of mass dimension $-1$ and $g_2$ is dimensionless. But, these numbers do not seem to play any 'mathematical' role.\nTo clarify my questions,\n\nWhat forbids me from proclaiming that $\\phi$ is dimensionless instead of mass dimension $1$?\n\nWhat is the exact difference between a dimensionless coupling constant and a coupling constant of mass dimension $-1$?\n\n\nThese issues seem very fundamental but always confuse me. Could anyone please provide a precise answer?", "output": "Mathematically, the concept of a physical dimension is expressed using one-dimensional vector spaces and their tensor products.\nFor example, consider mass.\nYou can add masses together and you know how to multiply a mass by a real number.\nThus, masses should form a one-dimensional real vector space $M$.\nThe same reasoning applies to other physical quantities, like length, time, temperature, etc.\nDenote the corresponding one-dimensional vector spaces by $L$, $T$, etc.\nWhen you multiply (say) some mass $m\u2208M$ and some length $l\u2208L$,\nthe result is $m\u2297l\u2208M\u2297L$.\nHere $M\u2297L$ is another one-dimensional real vector space,\nwhich is capable of \u201cstoring\u201d physical quantities of dimension mass times length.\nMultiplicative inverses live in the dual space:\nif $m\u2208M$, then $m^{-1}\u2208M^*$, where $\\def\\Hom{\\mathop{\\rm Hom}} \\def\\R{{\\bf R}} M^*=\\Hom(M,\\R)$.\nThe element $m^{-1}$ is defined as the unique element in $M^*$\nsuch that $m^{-1}(m)=1$, where $-(-)$ denotes the evaluation\nof a linear functional on $M$ on an element of $M$.\nObserve that $m \u2297 m^{-1} \u2208 M\u2297M^* \u2245 \\R$, where the latter canonical isomorphism\nsends $(f,m)$ to $f(m)$, so $m^{-1}$ is indeed the inverse of $m$.\nNext, you can also define powers of physical quantities,\ni.e., $m^t$, where $m\u2208M$ is a mass and $t\u2208\\R$ is a real number.\nThis is done using the notion of a density from differential geometry.\n(The case $\\def\\C{{\\bf C}} t\\in\\C$ works similarly, but with\ncomplex one-dimensional vector spaces.)\nIn order to do this, we must make $M$ into an oriented vector space.\nFor a one-dimensional vector space, this simply means that\nwe declare one out of the two half-rays in $M\u2216\\{0\\}$ to be positive,\nand denote it by $M_{>0}$.\nThis makes perfect sense for physical quantities like mass, length, temperature.\nOnce you have an orientation on $M$,\nyou can define $\\def\\Dens{\\mathop{\\rm Dens}} \\Dens_d(M)$\nfor $d\u2208\\R$ as the one-dimensional (oriented) real vector space\nwhose elements are equivalence classes of pairs $(a,m)$,\nwhere $a\u2208\\R$, $m\u2208M_{>0}$.\nThe equivalence relation is defined as follows:\n$(a,b\u22c5m)\u223c(a b^d,m)$ for any $b\u2208\\R_{>0}$.\nThe vector space operations are defined as follows:\n$0=(0,m)$ for some $m\u2208M_{>0}$,\n$-(a,m)=(-a,m)$,\n$(a,m)+(a',m)=(a+a',m)$,\nand $s(a,m)=(sa,m)$.\nIt suffices to add pairs with the same\nsecond component $m$ because the equivalence relation allows you to change the second component arbitrarily.\nOnce we have defined $\\Dens_d(M)$, given $m\u2208M_{>0}$ and $d\u2208\\R$,\nwe define $m^d\u2208\\Dens_d(M)$ as the equivalence class of the pair $(1,m)$.\nIt is easy to verify that all the usual laws of arithmetic,\nlike $m^d m^e = m^{d+e}$, $m^d n^d = (mn)^d$, etc.,\nare satisfied, provided that multiplication and reciprocals are interpreted as explained above.\nUsing the power operation operations we just defined,\nwe can now see that the equivalence class of $(a,m)$\nis equal to $a\u22c5m^d$, where $m\u2208M_{>0}$, $m^d\u2208\\Dens_d(M)_{>0}$,\nand $a\u22c5m^d\u2208\\Dens_d(M)$.\nThis makes the meaning of the equivalence relation clear.\nIn particular, for $d=-1$ we have a canonical isomorphism $\\Dens_{-1}(M)\u2192M^*$\nthat sends the equivalence class of $(1,m)$ to the element $m^{-1}\u2208M^*$ defined above,\nso the two notions of a reciprocal element coincide.\nIf you are dealing with temperature without knowing about the absolute zero,\nit can be modeled as a one-dimensional real affine space.\nThat is, you can make sense of a linear combination\n$$a_1 t_1 + a_2 t_2 + a_3 t_3$$\nof temperatures $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$\nas long as $a_1+a_2+a_3=1$,\nand you don't need to know about the absolute zero to do this.\nThe calculus of physical quantities can be extended\nto one-dimensional real affine spaces without much difficulty.\nNone of the above constructions make any noncanonical choices of\nphysical units (such as a unit of mass, for example).\nOf course, if you do fix such a unit $\u03bc\u2208M_{>0}$, you can construct\nan isomorphism $\\R\u2192\\Dens_d(M)$ that sends $a\u2208\\R$ to $a\u03bc^d$,\nand the above calculus (including the power operations)\nis identified with the usual operations on real numbers.\nIn general relativity, we no longer have a single one-dimensional\nvector space for length.\nInstead, we have the tangent bundle,\nwhose elements model (infinitesimal) displacements.\nThus, physical quantities no longer live in a fixed one-dimensional\nvector space, but rather are sections of a one-dimensional\nvector bundle constructed from the tangent bundle.\nFor example, the volume is an element of the total space\nof the line bundle of 1-densities $\\Dens_1(T M)$,\nand the length is now given by the line-bundle of $\u03bb$-densities $\\Dens_\u03bb(T M)$, where $\u03bb=1/\\dim M$.", "meta": {"id": 402497, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 402497, 'input_score': 27, 'output_score': 56, 'post_title': \"How do we give

Are they connected?", "output": "This is an interesting question, but one that might be hard to address completely. Let me see what I can do to help.\n\nReal Power Series:\nThe easiest way to address the connection between the two subjects is through the study of power series, as you have already had alluded to you. A power series is a particular kind of infinite sum (there are many different kinds of these) of the form\n$$\nf(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}a_k x^k.\n$$\nThey get their name from the fact that we are adding together powers of $x$ with different coefficients. In real analysis the argument of such a function (the \"$x$\" in $f(x)$) is taken to be a real number. And depending on the coefficients that are being multiplied with the powers of $x$, we get different intervals of convergence (intervals on which the sequence of partial sums converges.) For example, if $a_k$ is the $k$th Fibonacci number, then the radius of convergence ends up being $1/\\phi$, where $\\phi = (1+\\sqrt{5})/2$ is the \"golden ratio\".\nThe most common kind of power series that come up in calculus (and real analysis) are Taylor series or Maclaurin series. These series are created to represent (a portion) of some differentiable function. Let me try to make this a little more concrete. Pick some function $f(x)$ that is infinitely differentiable at a fixed value, say at $x=a$. The Taylor series corresponding to $f(x)$, centered at $a$, is given by\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k.\n$$\nA Maclaurin series is just a Taylor series where $a=0$. After playing around with the series a bit, you may notice a few things about it.\n\nWhen $x=a$, the only non-zero term in the series is the first one: the constant $f(a)$. This means that no matter what the radius of convergence is for the series, it will at least agree with the original function at this one point.\nTaking derivatives of the power series and evaluating them at $x=a$, we see that the power series and the original function $f(x)$ have the same derivatives at $a$. This is by construction, and not a coincidence.\nIf the radius of convergence is positive, then the interval on which the series converges will converge to the original function $f(x)$. In this way, we can say that $f(x)$ \"equals\" it's Taylor series, understanding that this equality may only hold on some interval centered at $a$, and perhaps not on the entire domain that $f(x)$ is defined on. You've already seen such an example with $(1+x^2)^{-1}$. In some extreme cases, such as with $\\sin x$ and $\\cos x$ as mentioned above, this equality ends up holding for ALL real values of $x$, and so the convergence is on all of $\\mathbb{R}$ and there is no harm completely equating the function with it's Taylor series.\nEven if the radius of convergence of a particular Taylor series (centered at $a$) is finite, it does not mean you cannot take other Taylor series (centered at other values than $a$) that also have a positive radius of convergence. For example, even though the Maclaurin series for $(1+x^2)^{-1}$ does not converge outside of the interval of radius 1, you can compute the Taylor series centered at $a=1$,\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{1+x^2} &= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{k!}  \\frac{d^k}{dx^k}\\left(\\frac{1}{1+x^2}\\right)\\Bigg|_{x=1}(x-1)^k \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)+\\frac{1}{2}(x-1)^2-3(x-1)^4+\\cdots, \\quad \\text{for $|x-1|<\\sqrt{2}$}.\n\\end{align}\n\nYou will then find that this new power series converges on a slightly larger radius than 1 (that's the $\\sqrt{2}$ mentioned above), and that the two power series (one centered at 0, the other centered at 1) overlap and agree for certain values of $x$.\nThe big take away that you should have about power series and Taylor series is that they are one and the same. Defined a function by a power series, and then take it's Taylor series centered at the same point; you will get the same series. Conversely, any infinitely-differentiable function that has a Taylor series with positive radius of convergence is uniquely determined by that power series.\nThis is where complex analysis beings to come into play...\n\nComplex Power Series:\nComplex numbers have many similar properties to real numbers. They form and algebra (you can do arithmetic with them); the only number you still cannot divide by is zero; and the absolute value of a complex number still tells you the distance from 0 that number is. In particular there is nothing stopping you from defining power series of complex numbers, with z=x+iy:\n$$\nf(z) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}c_k z^k.\n$$\nThe only difference now is that the coefficients $c_k$ can be complex numbers, and the radius of convergence is now relating to the radius of a circle (as opposed to the radius of an interval). Things may seem exactly like in the real-valued situation, but there is more lurking beneath the surface.\nFor starters, let me define some new vocabulary terms.\n\nWe say that a complex function is complex differentiable at some fixed value $z=w$ if the following limit exists:\n$$\n\\lim_{z\\to w}\\frac{f(z)-f(w)}{z-w}.\n$$\nIf this limit exists, we denote the value of the limit by $f'(w)$. This should look familiar, as it is the same limit definition for real-valued derivatives.\nIn the same way that we could create Taylor series for real-valued functions, we can also create Taylor series  (center at $z=w$) for complex-valued functions, provided the functions have an infinite number of derivatives at $w$ (sometimes referred to as being holomorphic at $w$):\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{f^{(k)}(w)}{k!}(z-w)^k.\n$$\nIf the Taylor series defined above has a positive radius of convergence then we say that $f$ is analytic at $w$. This vocabulary is also used in the case of real-valued Taylor series.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise in complex analysis is that the following conditions are all equivalent:\n\n$f(z)$ is complex differentiable at $z=w$.\n$f(z)$ is holomorphic at $w$. That is $f$ has an infinite number of derivatives at $z=w$. In real analysis this condition is sometimes referred to as being \"smooth\".\n$f(z)$ is analytic at $z=w$. That is it's Taylor series converges to $f(z)$ with some positive radius of convergence.\n\nThis means that being differentiable in the complex sense is a much harder thing to accomplish than in the real sense. Consider the contrast with the \"real-valued\" equivalents of the points made above:\n\nIn real analysis there are a number of functions with only finitely many derivatives. For example, $x^2 \\sin(1/x)$ has only one derivative at $x=0$, and $f'(x)$ is not even continuous, let alone twice differentiable.\nThere are also real-valued functions that are smooth (infinitely-differentiable) yet do not have a convergent Taylor series. An example is the function $e^{-1/x^2}$ which is smooth for every $x$, but for which every order of derivative at $x=0$ is equal to zero; this means every coefficient in the Maclaurin series is zero, and the radius of convergence is zero as well.\n\nThese kinds of pathologies do not occur in the complex world: one derivative is as good as an infinite number of derivatives; differentiability at one point translates to differentiability on a neighborhood of that point.\n\nLaurent  Series:\nA natural question that one might ask is what dictates the radius of convergence for a power series? In the real-valued case things seemed to be fairly unpredictable. However, in the complex-valued case things are much more elegant.\nLet $f(z)$ be differentiable at some point $z=w$. Then the radius of convergence for the Taylor series of $f(z)$ centered at $w$ will be the distance to the nearest complex number at which $f(z)$ fails to be differentiable. Think of it like dropping a pebble into a pool of water. The ripples will extend radially outward from the initial point of differentiability, all the way until the circular edge of the ripple hits the first \"singularity\" -- a point where $f(z)$ fails to be differentiable.\nTake the complex version of our previous example,\n$$\nf(z) = \\frac{1}{1+z^2}.\n$$\nThis is a ration function, and will be smooth for all values of $z$ where the denominator is non-zero. Since the only roots of $z^2 + 1$ are $z = i$ and $z = -i$, then $f(z)$ is differentiable/smooth/analytic at all values $w\\neq \\pm i$. This is precisely why the radius of convergence for the real-valued Maclaurin series is 1, as you've already noted: the shortest distance from $z=0$ to $z=\\pm i$ is 1. The real-valued Maclaurin series is just a \"snapshot\" or \"sliver\" of the complex-valued Taylor series centered at $z=0$. This is also why the radius of convergence for the real-valued Taylor series increases when you move away from zero; the distance to $\\pm i$ becomes greater, and so the complex-valued Taylor series can converge on a larger disk.\nSo now should come the question: when exactly does a complex function fail to be differentiable?\nWithout going into too many details from complex analysis, suffice it to say that complex functions fail to be differentiable when one of three things occurs:\n\nThe function has a \"singularity\" (think division by zero).\nThe function is defined in terms of the complex conjugate, $\\bar{z}$. For example, $f(z) = |z|^2 = z\\,\\bar{z}$.\nThe function involves logarithms or non-integer exponents (these two ideas are actually related).\n\nNumber 2. is perhaps the most egregious of the three issues, and it means that functions like $f(z) = |z|$ are actually differentiable nowhere. This is in stark contrast to the real-valued version $f(x) = |x|$, which is differentiable everywhere except at $x=0$ where there is a \"corner\".\nNumber 3. is actually not too bad, and it turns out that these kinds of functions are usually differentiable everywhere except along certain rays or line segments. To get into it further, however, will take us too far off course.\nNumber 1. is the best case scenario, and is the focus of this section of our discussion. Essentially, singularities are places where division by zero has occurred, and the extend to which something has \"gone wrong\" can be quantified. Let me try to elaborate.\nConsider the previous example of $f(z) = (1+z^2)^{-1}$. Again, since the denominator can factor into the product $(z+i)(z-i)$, then this means we could \"erase\" the singularity at $z=i$ by multiplying the function by a copy of $z-i$. In other words if\n$$\n g(z) = (z+i)f(z) = \\frac{z-i}{1+z^2},\n$$\nthen $g(z) = z+i$ for all $z\\neq i$, and $\\lim_{z\\to i}g(z) = 2i$ exists, and is no longer a singularity.\nSimilarly, if $f(z) = 1/(1+z^2)^3$, then we again have singularities at $z=\\pm i$. This time, however, multiplying $f(z)$ by only one copy of $z-i$ will not remove the singularity at $z=i$. Instead, we would need to multiply by three copies to get\n$$\n g(z) = (z-i)^3 f(z) = \\frac{(z-i)^3}{(1+z^2)^3},\n$$\nwhich again means that $g(z) = (z+i)^3$ for all $z\\neq i$, and that $\\lim_{z\\to i}g(z) = (2i)^3 = -8i$ exists.\nSingularities like this --- ones that can be \"removed\" through the use of multiplication of a finite number of linear terms --- are called poles. The order of the pole is the minimum number of liner terms need to remove the singularity.\nThe real-valued Maclaurin series for $\\sin x$ is given by\n$$\n \\sin x = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(2k+1)!}x^{2k+1},\n$$\nand has a infinite radius of convergence. This means that the complex version\n$$\n \\sin z = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}z^{2k+1} = z - \\frac{1}{3!}z^3 + \\frac{1}{5!}z^5 - \\cdots\n$$\nalso has an infinite range of convergence (such functions are called entire) and hence no singularities. From here it's easy to see that the function $(\\sin z)/z$ is analytic as well, with Taylor series\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin z}{z} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}z^{2k} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3!}z^2 + \\frac{1}{5!}z^4 - \\cdots\n$$\nHowever, a function like $(\\sin z)/z^3$ is not analytic at $z=0$, since dividing $\\sin z$ by $z^3$ would give us the following expression:\n$$\n \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3} = \\frac{1}{z^2} - \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{5!}z^2 - \\cdots\n$$\nBut notice that if we were to subtract the term $1/z^2$ from both sides we would be left again with a proper Taylor series\n$$\n \\frac{\\sin z}{z^3} - \\frac{1}{z^2} = \\frac{\\sin z - z}{z^3} = \\frac{1}{3!} + \\frac{1}{5!}z^2 - \\frac{1}{7!}z^4 + \\cdots\n$$\nThis idea of extending the idea of Taylor series to include terms with negative powers of $z$ is what is referred to a Laurent series. A Laurent series is a power series in which the powers of $z$ are allowed to take on negative values, as well as positive:\n$$\n f(z) := \\sum_{k = -\\infty}^{\\infty} c_k z^k\n$$\nIn this way we can expand complex functions around singular points in a fashion similar to expanding around analytic points.\nA pole, it turns out, is a singular point for which there are a finite number of terms with negative powers, such as with $(\\sin z)/z^3$. If, however, an infinite number of negative powers are needed to fully express a Laurent series, then this type of singular point is called an essential singularity. An excellent example of such a function can be made by taking an analytic function (one with a Taylor series) and replacing $z$ by $1/z$:\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin(1/z) &= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}(1/z)^k \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^k}{(2k+1)!}z^{-k} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{0}\\frac{(-1)^{-k}}{(1-2k)!}z^{k}\n\\end{align}\nThese kinds of singularities are quite severe and the behavior of complex functions around such a point is rather erratic. This also explains why the real-valued function $e^{-1/x^2}$ was so pathological. The Taylor series for $e^z$ is given by\n$$\ne^z = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k!}z^k\n$$\nand so\n\\begin{align}\ne^{-1/z^2} &= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k!}(-1/z^2)^k \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{k!}(-1)^k z^{-2k} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{0}\\frac{1}{(-k)!}(-1)^{-k} z^{2k}.\n\\end{align}\nHence there is an essential singularity at $z=0$, and so even though the real-valued version is smooth at $x=0$, there is no hope of differentiability in a disk around $z=0$.", "meta": {"id": 2936156, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 2936156, 'input_score': 29, 'output_score': 44, 'post_title': 'Are real and complex analysis related in any way?'}"}}

{"input": "I am reading this text:\n\nWhen in the real world are we checking to see if sets are vector spaces or not? The examples above seem like really specific sets...\nAre there any places where we redefined scalar multiplication like this?", "output": "You'll never have to prove something is a vector space in real life. You may want to prove something is a vector space, because vector spaces have a simply enormous amount of theory proven about them, and the non-trivial fact that you wish to establish about your specific object might boil down to a much more general, well-known result about vector spaces.\nHere's my favourite example. It's still a little artificial, but I came by it through simple curiousity, rather than any course, or the search for an example.\nConsider the logic puzzle here. It's a classic. You have a $5 \\times 5$ grid of squares, coloured black or white. Every time you press a square, it changes the square and the (up to four) adjacent squares from black to white or white to black. Your job is to press squares in such a way that you end up with every square being white.\nSo, my question to you is, can you form any configuration of white and black squares by pressing these squares? Put another way, is any $5 \\times 5$ grid of black and white squares a valid puzzle with a valid solution?\nWell, it turns out that this can be easily answered using linear algebra. We form a vector space of $5 \\times 5$ matrices whose entries are in the field $\\mathbb{Z}_2 = \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace$. We represent white squares with $0$ and black squares with $1$. Such a vector space is finite, and contains $2^{25}$ vectors. Note that every vector is its own additive inverse (as is the case for any vector space over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\nAlso note that the usual standard basis, consisting of matrices with $0$ everywhere, except for a single $1$ in one entry, forms a basis for our vector space. Therefore, the dimension of the space is $25$.\nPressing each square corresponds to adding one of $25$ vectors to the current vector. For example, pressing the top left square will add the vector\n$$\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.$$\nWe are trying to find, therefore, a linear combination of these $25$ vectors that will sum to the current vector (remember $-v = v$ for all our vectors $v$).\nSo, my question that I posed to you, boils down to asking whether these $25$ vectors span the $25$-dimensional space. Due to standard results in finite-dimensional linear algebra, this is equivalent to asking whether the set of $25$ vectors is linearly independent.\nThe answer is, no, they are not linearly independent. In particular, if you press the buttons highlighted in the following picture, you'll obtain the white grid again, i.e. the additive identity.\n\nTherefore, we have a non-trivial linear combination of the vectors, so they are linearly dependent, and hence not spanning. That is, there must exist certain configurations that cannot be attained, i.e. there are invalid puzzles with no solution.\nThe linear dependency I found while playing the game myself, and noticing some of the asymmetries of the automatically generated solutions, even when the problem itself was symmetric. Proving the linear dependence is as easy as showing the above picture. I still don't know of an elegant way to find an example of a puzzle that can't be solved though!

For example, taking the version of CIC defined in Benjamin Werner's thesis, it doesn't even make sense to remove Prop, as one doesn't have either Set or universes of Type.\nThe main variations one can consider in either of these theories are:\n\nUniverses: how many, and how are they defined (Palmgren, On Universes in Type Theory, discusses many inequivalent variations), and whether or not universe polymorphism is admitted.\nWhich inductive types/families: Agda admits Inductive-Recursive types, but there are many more mundane variations depending on how \"large\" the types in the constructors and eliminators are allowed, handling parameters vs indices, etc.\nInjectivity of type constructors.

This is partly because we publish more frequently, so it is ok that each individual paper has less signal about your specific contribution. This is not to say that single authored papers are not impressive, but credit is super-additive across authors, and all things being equal, you should prefer to have a better paper with more coauthors than a worse paper with fewer. This should push you towards collaboration, since collaborators make your research both more fun and generally stronger. \nOf course in hiring decisions, committees will attempt to figure out whether you were a significant contributor to the papers you worked on or not -- but this will be done largely through the letters you obtain.

{"input": "I am wondering what exactly is the relationship between the three aforementioned spaced. All of them seem to show up many times in: Linear Algebra, Topology, and Analysis. However, I feel like I'm missing the bigger picture of how these spaces relate to each other. For example, in my course in multi-dimensional analysis, we started out talking about metric spaces, but later suddenly switched to normed vector spaces, without any explicit mention of this transition. In linear algebra we usually talked about inner product spaces, and in topology we talked about metric spaces and topological spaces. \nThe bigger picture of the relation between these three is still unclear to me. Which is used where, for what reason, and how do they relate?\nI do know the definitions of all three of them: \nA metric space is a pair $(S,d)$ with $S$ a set and $d: S \\times S \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ a metric:\n\n$d(x,x) = 0$ for all $x \\in S$ and $d(x,y) >0$ for $x \\neq y$, \n$d(x,y) = d(y,x)$, \n$d(x,z) \\leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$. \n\nA (real) inner product space is a pair $(V,\\langle \\cdot \\rangle)$ where $V$ is a (real) vector space and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle: V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is an inner product: \n\n$\\langle v,w \\rangle = \\langle w,v \\rangle$, \n$\\langle a_1 v_1 + a_2v_2,w \\rangle = a_1\\langle v_1,w \\rangle + a_2\\langle v_2,w \\rangle$ for all $a_1,a_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}$, \n$v \\neq 0 \\Longrightarrow \\langle v,v \\rangle > 0$. \n\nA (real) normed vector space is a pair $(V,\\|\\cdot\\|)$ where $V$ is a (real) vector space and $\\|\\cdot\\|: V \\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}: v \\mapsto \\|v\\|$ is a norm on $V$: \n\n$\\|v\\| \\geq 0$ and $\\|v\\|  = 0 \\ \\Longleftrightarrow \\ v = 0$. \nFor $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $v \\in V$ we have $\\|tv\\| = |t|\\|v\\|$\n$\\|v+w\\| \\leq \\|v\\| + \\|w\\|$. \n\nI also know that an inner product gives rise to a norm by taking $\\|v\\| = \\sqrt{\\langle v,v \\rangle}$, for example the Euclidean norm derives from the standard inner product on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in this way. And Cauchy-Schwarz: $|\\langle x,y \\rangle| \\leq \\|x\\|\\|y\\|$. \nI'm not interested in details about the definitions but in the intuition and bigger picture of these three spaces, and how they show up in Analysis.", "output": "You have the following inclusions:\n$$\\{ \\textrm{inner product vector spaces} \\} \\subsetneq \\{ \\textrm{normed vector spaces} \\} \\subsetneq \\{ \\textrm{metric spaces} \\} \\subsetneq \\{ \\textrm{topological spaces} \\}.$$\nGoing from the left to the right in the above chain of inclusions, each \"category of spaces\" carries less structure. In inner product spaces, you can use the inner product to talk about both the length and the angle of vectors (because the inner product induces a norm). In a normed vector space, you can only talk about the length of vectors and use it to define a special metric on your space which will measure the distance between two vectors. In a metric space, the elements of the space don't even have to be vectors (and even if they are, the metric itself doesn't have to come from a norm) but you can still talk about the distance between two points in the space, open balls, etc. In a topological space, you can't talk about the distance between two points but you can talk about open neighborhoods.\nBecause of this inclusion, everything that works for general topological spaces will work in particular for all other spaces, but there are some things you can do in (say) normed vector spaces which don't make sense in a general topological space. For example, if you have a function $f \\colon V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ on a normed vector space, you can define the directional derivative of $f$ at $p \\in V$ in the direction $v \\in V$ by the limit\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{f(p + tv) - f(p)}{t}. $$\nIn the definition, you are using the fact that you can add the vector $tv$ to the point $p$. If you try to mimick this definition in a topological space, then since the set itself doesn't have the structure of a vector space, you can't add two elements so this definition doesn't make sense. That's why during your studies you sometimes restrict your attention to a smaller category of spaces which has more structure so you can do more things in it. \nYou can discuss the notions of continuity, compactness only in the category (context) of topological spaces (but for reasons of simplicity it is often done in the beginning of one's studies in the category of metric spaces). However, once you want to discuss differentiability, then (in first approximation, before moving to manifolds) you need to restrict your category and work with normed vector spaces. If you also want to discuss the angle that two curves make, you will need to further restrict your category and work with inner product vector spaces in which the notion of angle makes sense, etc.", "meta": {"id": 2841855, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 2841855, 'input_score': 22, 'output_score': 48, 'post_title': 'Relation between metric spaces, normed vector spaces, and inner product space.'}"}}

{"input": "I'm not looking for the definition of discrete topology given in textbooks; I'm wondering why the word 'discrete' was chosen.\nI mean, the concept of discrete topology is built up from sets, which are built from objects--which are discrete. So, if we're looking for a word to differentiate power sets as topologies from other topologies, and we use the adjective 'discrete' to accomplish that differentiation because the power set is composed of discrete objects--then, by similar reasoning, couldn't we call all topologies on sets 'discrete'.\nBecause they're built from discrete objects and compositions, too. All of them. All topologies.\nThere must be some other reason we call discrete topologies 'discrete'. What is it?", "output": "The discrete topology has a topological structure which perfectly reveals the discrete nature of the underlying set of points\nYou can consider a set to be a discrete collection of objects. To a given set $X$, you can assign a variety of topologies. Let's argue for the appropriateness of calling this particular topology \"discrete\".\n\nThe discrete topology is the finest topology\u2014it cannot be subdivided further. If you think of the elements of the set as indivisible \"discrete\" atoms, each one appears as a singleton set. You can effectively \"see\" the individual points in the topology itself.\nContrast this with the indiscrete topology, consisting only of $X$ itself and $\\varnothing$. This topology obscures everything about how many points were in the original set. It fully agglomerates the points of the set together.\nRevisiting this point, it's sometimes helpful to think of topologies as obscuring or blurring together the underlying points of the set. Topologies are all about nearness relations: points in an open set are in the vicinity of one another. If there are two points that never appear alone in an open set, those points are topologically indistinguishable. From the perspective of the topology, they are so close as to be identical.\nIt is therefore remarkable that the discrete topology has no indistinguishable points. The discrete topology is the topology that obscures nothing about the underlying set. Each point in the set is clearly highlighted and distinguishable and recoverable as an open singleton set in the topology.\nIf you think of topologies that can arise from metrics, the discrete topology arises from metrics such as $d(x,y) = \\begin{cases}0 & x=y\\\\1&x\\neq y\\end{cases}$. This metric \"shatters\" the points $X$, isolating each one within its own unit ball. In such a space, the only convergent sequences are the ones that are eventually constant; you can't find points arbitrarily close to any other points. Because points are isolated in this way, it makes sense to call the space \"discrete\".\nEvery function from a discrete space is automatically continuous. I'd argue that for this reason, the discrete topology is the one that best \"represents\" $X$ in topological space. Indeed, in many ways the nature of a set is characterized by its functions, and the nature of a topological space is characterized by its continuous functions. \nSo, note that if $T$ is any topological space, there's a natural bijective correspondence between functions $f:X\\rightarrow \\mathsf{set}(T)$ and continuous morphisms $g:\\mathsf{discrete}(X)\\rightarrow T$. For every function on $X$, you can find a continuous function on $\\mathsf{discrete}(X)$, and given any continuous function on $\\mathsf{discrete}(X)$, you can uniquely recover a function on $X$. \nThe discrete topology best represents the structure of the set $X$ which, as you say, is discretized into individual points.\nThroughout abstract algebra, isomorphisms describe which structures are \"the same\". A topological isomorphism (a homeomorphism) between two topologies says that they are essentially the same topology. An isomorphism of sets is just a bijection; it says that the sets contain the same number of elements.\nContinuing the discussion of functions above, two discrete topologies are topologically isomorphic (homeomorphic) if and only if their underlying sets are isomorphic as sets (bijective). Put casually, this means that the discrete-topology-creating process maintains the similarity and differences between the underlying sets: discrete topologies are the same if and only if their underlying sets are.\nThis is all the more important when we realize that sets are the same when they have the same number of points. Hence discrete topologies are the same when (and only when) their underlying sets have \"discrete points\" in the same quantity. You can count the points in a discrete topology through isomorphisms, and the discrete topology is the only topology for which this is possible.", "meta": {"id": 2614268, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 2614268, 'input_score': 25, 'output_score': 43, 'post_title': 'Why is a discrete topology called a discrete topology?'}"}}

{"input": "How can we define in a proof assistant (eg., Coq) a notion of a 2-player game, where each player is a program that has access to the opponent's source code?\nBackground: In Open Source Game Theory, we think about bots that reason about each other (prove theorems), knowing the other's source code. I would like implement such bots in a proof assistant, if possible. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07006.pdf, Open Problem 4)\nWhat I have in mind would looks like this:\nInductive outcome := Cooperate | Defect.\n(*  Dupoc is short for Defect Unless Proof of Cooperation   *)\nDefinition Dupoc (n:N) (bot2 : N -> bot -> outcome) : N -> bot -> outcome :=\n    'try for n steps to find a proof that bot2 n self = Cooperate, if found':\n        return Cooperate\n    else\n        return Defect.\n\nThe point is that we want to run the agents together with each other as input:\nDefinition game n1 bot1 n2 bot2 := (bot1 n1 bot2, bo2 n2 bo1).\n\nOf course, the type bot does not exist as I have written it. Is there a way to actually make this happen?\nThe other problem is that the bot's function is trying to find a proof and returning a bool that reflects the success. Is this possible in some proof assistant? The proof assistant would have to have access to its own inner workings somehow, which seems hard.\nI think I could solve the problem by having a Coq implementation in Coq.\nThen I could have, like in the paper:\nInductive CoqTokens := ...\nDefinition BotExpression := ... (* A valid expression for a Bot *)\nClass Bot := {\n    play : BotExpression -> outcome,\n    source : BotExpression (* This should be the source code for 'play' in our Coq-in-Coq implementation *)\n}.\nDefinition game bot1 bot2 := (bot1.play bot2.source, bot2.play bot1.source).\n\nBut this seems very much work if it is possible. The Coq implementation in Coq still needs to contain everything about proofing. And I am not sure if it actually solves the problem.", "output": "As you found out, the usual technique to solve this kind of difficulty is to introduce a notion of \"code\" (what you called BotExpression), which expresses the behaviour of your bot. Once you are happy with your codes, you can in a second time define a \"decoding\" function, something which takes in a code and spits out the expression, but this time as an actual Coq function. Taking the notations from your question, this means that you should be able to define a function that takes in source and outputs play. Note that to do this you do not have to reify all the syntax of Coq. Indeed, the actions available for your bots can probably be defined with a set of primitives smaller than full-fledged Coq. This lets you avoid the problem of using some form of self-description of the meta-language (which are very complicated beasts).\nSimilarly, you might also want to have such an encoding for proofs, again because your bots need to manipulate \"concrete\" data rather than meta-proofs in the ambient theory. Regarding formalization of logic, and also to give you ideas on the general code/decoding setting, you might want to give a look at eg. this library formalizing first-order logic.\nFinally, there is a second issue you might stumble upon, either in the definition of your decoding function, or that of a play, which is related to the definition of functions in Coq. Indeed, as Coq lets you only define total/terminating functions, quite a lot of things with a \"self-recursive\" flavour are not definable as functions, as they would lead to non-terminating behaviour. In such a case, a standard solution is to replace the type A -> B by the type A -> B -> Prop, ie. replace an actual function by its graph. This avoids termination issues, and also determinism: since you do not encode a game as a function, you can have multiple choices to move on. Moreover, if you define your relation as an inductive one, you can reason by induction on it, which is probably the kind of reasoning principles you will be after.", "meta": {"id": 1779, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 1779, 'input_score': 10, 'output_score': 9, 'post_title': \"How can we formalize a game where each player is a program having access to opponent's code?\"}"}}

For a weak solution we can only say that there exists some probability space where the SDE holds (with a new brownian motion in the space). \n\nAs you can tell I am confused with this topic some clarifications would be amazing.", "output": "The main difference between weak and strong solutions is indeed that for strong solutions we are given a Brownian motion on a given probability space whereas for weak solutions we are free to choose the Brownian motion and the probability space.\n\nDefinition: Let $(B_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ be a Brownian motion with admissible filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$. A progressively measurable process $(X_t,\\mathcal{F}_t)$ is a strong solution with initial condition $\\xi$ if $$X_t-X_0 = \\int_0^t \\sigma(s,X_s) \\, dB_s + \\int_0^t b(s,X_s) \\, ds, \\qquad X_0 =\\xi \\tag{1}$$ holds almost surely for all $t \\geq 0$.\nDefinition: A stochastic process $(X_t,\\mathcal{F}_t)$ on some probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$ is called a weak solution with initial distribution $\\mu$ if there exists a Brownian motion $(B_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$ such that $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ is an admissible filtration, $\\mathbb{P}(X_0 \\in \\cdot) = \\mu(\\cdot)$ and $$X_t-X_0 = \\int_0^t \\sigma(s,X_s) \\, dB_s + \\int_0^t b(s,X_s) \\, ds$$ holds almost surely for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nAs a consequence of these definitions, we have to consider different notions of uniqueness. For strong solutions we are typically looking for pathwise unique solutions, i.e. if $(X_t^{(1)})_{t \\geq 0}$ and $(X_t^{(2)})_{t \\geq 0}$ are strong solutions to $(1)$ with the same initial condition, then pathwise uniqueness means $$\\mathbb{P} \\left( \\sup_{t \\geq 0} |X_t^{(1)}-X_t^{(2)}|=0 \\right)=1.$$ As the following simple example shows it doesn't make sense to talk about pathwise uniqueness of weak solutions.\n\nExample 1: Let $(W_t^{(1)})_{t \\geq 0}$ and $(W_t^{(2)})_{t \\geq 0}$ be two Brownian motions (possibly defined on different probability spaces), then both $X_t^{(1)} := W_t^{(1)}$ and $X_t^{(2)} := W_t^{(2)}$ are weak solutions to the SDE $$dX_t = dB_t, \\qquad X_0 = 0$$ Why? According to the definition we are free choose the driving Brownian motion, so we can set $B_t^{(1)} := W_t^{(1)}$ and $B_t^{(2)} := W_t^{(2)}$, respectively, and then $$dX_t^{(i)} = dB_t^{(i)} \\quad \\text{for $i=1,2$}.$$\n\nWhat do we learn from this? Since weak solutions might be defined on different probability spaces, there is no (immediate) way to compute probabilities of the form $\\mathbb{P}(X_t^{(1)}=X_t^{(2)})$ for two weak solutions $(X_t^{(1)})_{t \\geq 0}$ and $(X_t^{(2)})_{t \\geq 0}$, and therefore we cannot even attempt to talk about pathwise uniqueness. For the same reason, it doesn't make sense to talk about pointwise initial conditions $\\xi$ for weak solutions (... for this we would need to fix some probability space on which $\\xi$ lives...); instead we only prescribe the initial distribution of $X_0$.\nThe next example shows that we cannot expect to have pathwise uniqueness even if the weak solutions are defined on the same probability space.\n\nExample 2: Let $(W_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ be a Brownian motion. It follows from Example 1 that $X_t^{(1)} := W_t$ and $X_t^{(2)} := -W_t$ are weak solutions to the SDE $$dX_t = dB_t, \\qquad X_0 =0.$$ Clearly, $\\mathbb{P}(X_t^{(1)} = X_t^{(2)}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_t=0)=0$.\n\nThe \"good\" notion of uniqueness for weak solutions is weak uniqueness, i.e. uniqueness in distribution (= the solutions have the same finite-dimensional distributions).\nTypically it is much easier to prove the existence (and/or uniqueness of) a weak solution the the existence (and/or uniqueness) of a strong solution.\n\nExample 3: The SDE $$dX_t = - \\text{sgn}\\,(X_t) \\, dB_t, \\qquad X_0 = 0 \\tag{2}$$ has a weak solution but no strong solution.\n\nLet's prove that the SDE has a weak solution. Let $(X_t,\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ be some Brownian motion and define $$W_t := -\\int_0^t \\text{sgn} \\, (X_s) \\, dX_s.$$ It follows from L\u00e9vy's characterization that $(W_t,\\mathcal{F}_t)$ is also a Brownian motion. Since $$dW_t = - \\text{sgn} \\, (X_t) \\, dX_t$$ implies $$dX_t = - \\text{sgn} \\, (X_t) \\, dW_t$$ this means that $(X_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ is a weak solution to $(2)$. For a proof that a strong solution does not exist see e.g. Example 19.16 in the book by Schilling & Partzsch on Brownian motion.\nLet me finally mention that weak solutions are closely related to martingale problems; in this answer I tried to give some insights on the connection between the two notions.", "meta": {"id": 2987743, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 2987743, 'input_score': 43, 'output_score': 50, 'post_title': 'Difference between weak ( or martingale ) and strong solutions to SDEs'}"}}

{"input": "In a racing video game series named Trackmania, there is a game mechanic where when you hit a jump and the car is in mid-air, you can stop the car from pitching downward by tapping on the brakes.\nI am curious if this mechanic has some basis in real physics. What would happen if a car were pitching nose down while in the air, and you hit the brakes thus stopping the rotating wheels. Would that affect the car's pitch, and if so, how?", "output": "It will affect pitch, but not the way it works in the game. In the game, braking while in the air stops your pitch axis rotation. In real life, it does something completely different.\nThe wheels have angular momentum. When the wheels are slowed, this angular momentum must be conserved. This results in a transfer of angular momentum from the wheel to the vehicle.\nSince the wheels are moving clockwise in relation to a vehicle travelling left-to-right (i.e. the top of the wheel is moving toward the front of the car, and the bottom of the wheel is moving toward the rear) the car will also start to rotate clockwise, pitching the nose down. For a car already starting to pitch down after a jump, this will cause it to pitch down even faster, the opposite of what it does in-game.\nWe can even calculate a rough magnitude of the effect!\nFor simplicity, let's state some assumptions:\n\nthis is a rear-wheel drive vehicle with stationary front wheels\nboth rear wheels are moving at the same angular velocity (no slip diff)\nboth rear wheels are the same size and have the same mass\nthe rear axle is a rigid balanced cylinder (i.e. its center of mass is the center of the axle)\nthe brakes bring the wheels to a complete stop\nwe ignore the motion of the driveshaft, flywheel, clutch, gearbox, and other parts of the drivetrain\nwe ignore air resistance, lift, and all other aerodynamics\n\nEach of the two rear wheels can be approximated as a cylindrical mass whose center of mass is the axle joint. The same can be said for the rear driveshaft - it's a long cylinder. As such, the momentum of each of these bodies can be described by spin angular momentum, which is angular momentum about the center of mass. This is in contrast to orbital angular momentum, which is angular momentum about an arbitrary point.\nAngular momentum is expressed as $L=I\\omega$, where $I$ is the angular moment of inertia and $\\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second. You can think of the angular moment of inertia as a way to describe the mass distribution of an object about its axis (or axes) of rotation. A cube, a cylinder, and a sphere all have different moments of inertia, and those moments also change depending on where you put the axis of rotation (through the center, on an edge, etc.)\nA cylinder with mass $m$ and radius $r$ rotating about its $z$ axis has an angular moment of inertia described by $I = \\frac 1 2 mr^2$.\n\nAs such, the moment of inertia for each wheel can be approximated by $I = \\frac 1 2 mr^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the wheel and $r$ is the radius of the wheel. The moment of inertia for the axle can be described similarly, since we can model that as a cylinder too.\nGiven that we have two wheels rotating about the same axis, we can think of them as a combined cylinder of the same radius but with twice the mass, which cancels out the $\\frac 1 2$ term. We can then add the moment of inertia for the axle to get the total moment of inertia:\n$$I_T = m_W {r_W}^2 + \\frac 1 2 m_A {r_A}^2$$\n(with $T$ meaning total, $W$ meaning wheels, and $A$ meaning axle)\nThis can then be plugged into the angular momentum equation, $L=I\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular velocity in radians per second.\n$$L = \\omega \\left(m_W {r_W}^2 + \\frac 1 2 m_A {r_A}^2\\right)$$\nIf we assume that the vehicle's wheels have remained at a constant angular velocity since leaving the ground, we can estimate $\\omega$ from the vehicle's land speed at the time of take-off and the radius of the wheel including the tyre.\nOne revolution of the wheel moves the vehicle forward by the circumference of that wheel, and the circumference is $2\\pi r$. If we take the car's velocity in meters per second (1mph \u2248 0.447m/s) and divide it by the wheel circumference, that tells us how many times the wheel was rotating per second. One rotation is 360\u00b0, or $2\\pi$ radians. As such:\n$$\\omega \\approx \\frac {v_C} {2\\pi {r_W}} \\times 2\\pi = \\frac {v_C} {r_W}$$\nWhere $v_C$ is the car's velocity at the point of take-off, and $r_W$ is the wheel radius.\nSubstituting this into our previous equation, we get:\n$$L = \\frac {v_C} {r_W} \\left(m_W {r_W}^2 + \\frac 1 2 m_A {r_A}^2\\right)$$\nWhere $L$ is the angular momentum, $v_C$ is the velocity of the car at take-off (for the purposes of angular velocity estimation), $r_W$ is the radius of the rear wheels including the tyre, $m_W$ is the mass of each of the two rear wheels including the tyre, $m_A$ is the mass of the rear axle, and $r_A$ is the radius of the rear axle.\nFor the sake of simplicity in this worked example, we'll assume that the front wheels aren't spinning, even though in practice it would make sense for the front wheels to be rotating at the same angular velocity as the rear wheels. While it is entirely possible to calculate the resultant angular velocity of the car as a result of both the front and rear wheels, including the case where the front wheels are not facing straight forward, the calculations are much easier to follow in a system with angular momentum being transferred between two bodies in a single axis.\nLet's try a quick test-case:\n\nEach wheel weighs 25 kg including the tyre.\nThe rear wheels have a radius of 25 cm (approximating a 16\" diameter alloy with 2\" thick tyres).\nThe rear axle is 6 cm in diameter and weighs 50 kg.\nThe car was travelling at 40 m/s (roughly 90 mph) when it left the ground.\n\nPlugging these numbers in, we get:\n$$L = \\frac {40~\\mathrm{m~s}^{-1}} {0.25~\\mathrm{m}} \\left(25~\\mathrm{kg} \\times (0.25~\\mathrm{m})^2 + \\frac 1 2 50~\\mathrm{kg} \\times (0.06~\\mathrm{m})^2\\right) = 265.4~\\mathrm{kg}\u22c5\\mathrm{m}^2\u22c5\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNote that kg\u22c5m2\u22c5s\u22121 are the units for momentum.\nThis is all well and good, but what does this mean in terms of the movement of the car?\nSince angular momentum must be conserved, the change in momentum in the wheels is passed on to the body of the car. The equations we used above can be used in reverse - we can start with angular momentum and a moment of inertia and use it to find the resulting angular velocity!\nHowever, there's a bit of a hitch: the angular momentum isn't being applied at the center of mass of the car, but instead at the location of the rear axle. This means that the car's movement is described by orbital angular momentum, not spin angular momentum. The car also isn't a cylinder, so we need a different equation.\nTo keep things simple, let's imagine the car is a cuboid of uniform mass with the real axle running along one of the bottom edges:\n\nThe moment of inertia for such a cuboid is described by:\n$$I = \\frac {m(a^2 + b^2)} {12}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass, $a$ is the side of length a in meters, and $b$ is the side of length b in meters.\nWe can now derive the equation for estimating the angular momentum of the car, using $L=I\\omega$:\n$$L_C \\approx \\omega \\times \\frac {m_C(l^2 + h^2)} {12}$$\nwhere $L_C$ is the angular momentum of the car, $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the car, $m_C$ is the mass of the car, and $l$ and $h$ are the length and height of the car respectively in meters.\nThe equation above is written in terms of $L_C$, so to find the resulting angular velocity of the car we need to rearrange it in terms of $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega \\approx \\frac {L_C} {\\left(\\frac {m_C(l^2 + h^2)} {12}\\right)} = \\frac {12L_C} {m_C(l^2 + h^2)}$$\nLet's continue with our test case by defining the last few parameters:\n\nThe car is approximately 1.25 m tall and 4.75 m long.\nThe car weighs 1600 kg. After subtracting the mass of the wheels and rear axle, that's 1500 kg. (edit: thanks to nitsua60 for pointing out that since the wheels and axle move as part of the car, their mass counts as part of the overall moment of inertia and should not be subtracted)\n\nSince we know that the angular momentum being transferred from the wheels and axle to the car is 265.4 kg\u22c5m2\u22c5s-1, we can now plug everything in:\n$$\\omega \\approx \\frac {12 \\times 265.4~\\mathrm{kg}\u22c5\\mathrm{m}^2\u22c5\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} {1600~\\mathrm{kg} \\times (4.75^2 + 1.25^2)~\\mathrm{m}^2} = 0.0825~\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nThis is equivalent to 4.73\u00b0/s of nose-down rotation - small, but fairly noticeable!\nThe approximations here are crude, but they give you a good idea of how the conservation of angular momentum results in the downward pitch when the brakes slow down the spinning wheels.\nIt is possible to calculate the system's behaviour more accurately by considering the three-dimensional moment of inertia around the rear axle, angular momentum transfer of the flywheel and drivetrain (the car will tend to tilt slightly to one side as the drivetrain slows), non-uniform mass distribution of the car, air resistance, lift, and other aerodynamic effects, but the calculations are significantly more complicated and beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nAs a final wrap-up point, if you express the conservation of angular momentum between two objects ($a$ and $b$) as a single equation, you can gain some intuition for the behaviour of the objects as a function of their mass, size, and velocity.\n$$I_a\\omega_a = I_b\\omega_b$$\nIf we rearrange for $\\omega_b$ we can see how a change in angular velocity on object $a$ affects the angular velocity of object $b$:\n$$\\omega_b = \\frac {I_a} {I_b} \\omega_a$$\nWhen angular momentum is transferred, the change in angular velocity in object $b$ is a function of the ratio between the two angular moments of inertia. Since the moment of inertia of an object is proportional to its mass and size, a smaller lighter object imparts less angular velocity to a larger heavier object.", "meta": {"id": 734513, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 734513, 'input_score': 39, 'output_score': 59, 'post_title': 'Could pressing the brakes on a car in mid-air affect its pitch rotation?'}"}}

{"input": "Consider all the integers from 1-13. Without reusing any integers, find a set of three integers for which all numbers 1-13 may be created using only addition and subtraction. Prove that for all such sets, it is not possible to create a sum of 14.\nFor this question, I've identified that 1,3,9 is a possible set of integers that fulfill the requirements as follows:\n$1 = 1 \\\\ 2 = 3 - 1 \\\\ 3 = 3 \\\\ 4 = 1 + 3 \\\\ 5 = 9 - 1 - 3 \\\\ 6 = 9 - 3 \\\\ 7 = 9 + 1 - 3 \\\\ 10 = 9 + 1 \\\\ 11 = 9 + 3 - 1 \\\\ 12 = 9 + 3 \\\\ 13 = 1 + 3 + 9$\nThe obvious reason that this set of integers will not add up to 14 is that their sum is 13, smaller than 14. Hence, we cannot get a sum of 14. But I'm not sure if this is the only set of integers that fulfill the requirements and therefore cannot prove that all of these sets of integers will not create a sum of 14.
