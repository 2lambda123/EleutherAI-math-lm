Observers moving at different velocities would observe the black hole to have different values of momentum. A fundamental property needs to have the same value for all observers.\nThe relativistic version of momentum is the four-momentum, and a black hole can have this property.

{"input": "I am now confused with such problem as title goes. To be exact, the problem is\n\nDoes there exist a functor from $A:\\mathsf{Field}\\to \\mathsf{Field}$ with a natural transformation from identity functor $\\iota: \\operatorname{id}\\to A$ such that for each $F$, $A(F)$ is the algebraically closure of $F$ through $\\iota_F:F\\to A(F)$?\n\nIt is not easy rather than first glimpse. Let me explain.\nNote that, the existence of algebraic closure only ensures that there exist a map from $\\operatorname{Obj}(\\mathsf{Field})$ to itself. Since the \"extension\" property is not unique, it is not generally true that we can extend the map to $\\operatorname{Mor}(\\mathsf{Field})$ for arbitrary choice of algebraic closure.\n\nFor example, consider the fields\n$$\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\sqrt{2}] &\\to & \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\sqrt{2}]\\\\\n\\uparrow &&\\uparrow \\\\\n\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}] & \\to & \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}]\n\\end{array}$$\nIf we choose the algebraically closure of $\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\sqrt{2}] & \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}, \\sqrt{2}]\\\\ & \\mathbb{Q}[\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}]\\end{matrix}\\right]$ by inclusion to $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$, and the closure of $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt[3]{2}]\\to \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$ by $\\sqrt[3]{2}\\mapsto \\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}$. \nWe cannot extend a well-defined functor. Similar problem exists for transcendental extension, for example, square like this\n$$\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\mathbb{C}[X,Y] &\\to & \\mathbb{C}[X^2,Y]\\\\\n\\uparrow &&\\uparrow \\\\\n\\mathbb{C}[X] & \\to & \\mathbb{C}[X^2]\n\\end{array}$$\nA reasonable method is to avoid phenomenon above is as follow. \nFix an algebraically closed field $F$, and take all of its subfields as \"skeleton\", then fix an isomorphism to a subfields of $F$ from all fields whose algebraic closure is $F$ up to an isomorphism. The isomorphic class of algebraically closure are completely dependen by its characteristic and the transcendental dimension over prime field $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{F}_p$. \nNow the problem is how to naturally chose extensions for endmorphisms. But unfortunately, the choice is fragile. For instance, consider the following diagram\n$$\\begin{array}{ccccl}\n\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{2}] &\\to & \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{2}] &: &\\sqrt{3}\\mapsto -\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\\\\n\\uparrow &&\\uparrow \\\\\n\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{3}] & \\to & \\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{3}] &:&\\sqrt{3}\\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}$$\nThere is no suitable choice such that \n$$\\begin{array}{ccccl}\n\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} &\\to & \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} &: &\\sqrt{3}\\mapsto -\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto \\pm \\sqrt{2}\\\\\n\\parallel &&\\parallel \\\\\n\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}& \\to & \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} &:&\\sqrt{3}\\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}\n\\end{array}$$\ncommutes for both $\\pm=+$ and $\\pm=-$.", "output": "No, this is not possible.  For instance, let $K$ be any field with a automorphism $f:K\\to K$ whose order is finite and greater than $2$.  Then $A(f):A(K)\\to A(K)$ would be an automorphism of the same order extending $f$.  But no such automorphism exists: by the Artin-Schreier theorem, any finite-order automorphism of an algebraically closed field has order at most $2$.\nOr without using any big theorems, you can find problems just looking at finite extensions.  For instance, if $f$ is the Frobenius automorphism of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ then $F(f)$ is an extension to an algebraic closure which still has order $2$.  Since $\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}$ is normal over $\\mathbb{F}_{p}$, $F(f)$ restricts to an automorphism of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^4}$, which must be the Frobenius squared in order to have order $2$.

My question is simply why type theorists prefer to use : over $\\in$? If a type $T$ is a set of values then it makes perfect sense to write $t \\in T$, no new notation needed. \nIs this similar to how some cs writers prefer $3n^2 = O(n^2)$ even thought it is abuse of notation and should be written $3n^2 \\in O(n^2)$?", "output": "The main reason to prefer the colon notation $t : T$ to the membership relation $t \\in T$ is that the membership relation can be misleading because types are not (just) collections.\n[Supplemental: I should note that historically type theory was written using $\\in$. Martin-L\u00f6f's conception of type was meant to capture sets constructively, and already Russell and Whitehead used $\\epsilon$ for the class memebrship. It would be interesting to track down the moment when $:$ became more prevalent than $\\in$.]\nA type describes a certain kind of construction, i.e., how to make objects with a certain structure, how to use them, and what equations holds about them.\nFor instance a product type $A \\times B$ has introduction rules that explain how to make ordered pairs, and elimination rules explaining that we can project the first and the second components from any element of $A \\times B$. The definition of $A \\times B$ does not start with the words \"the collection of all ...\" and neither does it say anywhere anything like \"all elements of $A \\times B$ are pairs\" (but it follows from the definition that every element of $A \\times B$ is propositionally equal to a pair). In constrast, the set-theoretic definition of $X \\times Y$ is stated as \"the set of all ordered pairs ...\".\nThe notation $t : T$ signifies the fact that $t$ has the structure described by $T$.\nA type $T$ is not to be confused with its extension, which is the collection of all objects of type $T$.  A type is not determined by its extension, just like a group is not determined by its carrier set. Furthermore, it may happen that two types have the same extension, but are different, for instance:\n\nThe type of all even primes larger than two: $\\Sigma (n : \\mathbb{N}) . \\mathtt{isprime}(n) \\times \\mathtt{iseven}(n) \\times (n > 2)$. \nThe type of all odd primes smaller than two: $\\Sigma (n : \\mathbb{N}) . \\mathtt{isprime}(n) \\times \\mathtt{isodd}(n) \\times (n < 2)$.\n\nThe extension of both is empty, but they are not the same type.\nThere are further differences between the type-theoretic $:$ and the set-theoretic $\\in$. An object $a$ in set theory exists independently of what sets it belongs to, and it may belong to several sets. In contrast, most type theories satisfy uniqueness of typing: if $t : T$ and $t : U$ then $T \\equiv U$. Or to put it differently, a type-theoretic construction $t$ has precisely one type $T$, and in fact there is no way to have just an object $t$ without its (uniquely determined) type.\nAnother difference is that in set theory we can deny the fact that $a \\in A$ by writing $\\lnot (a \\in A)$ or $a \\not\\in A$. This is not possible in type theory, because $t : T$ is a judgement which can be derived using the rules of type theory, but there is nothing in type theory that would allow us to state that something has not been derived.

{"input": "I'm currently taking a third-year electromagnetism course (we use Griffiths), and we have begun covering approximations of our potential function, $\\text{V} =\\int\\frac{k \\text{dQ}}{\\textbf{||r||}}$, where dQ is the charge distribution that can depend on r. Mainly, we've used both the Taylor Series and the Multipole Expansion to help approximate our potential function at large distances.\nHowever, I'm still very confused about the purpose of using these approximations. What do they tell us that our regular potential function doesn't? Is there something revealing if we use an approximation rather than the potential function?

For example, in this passage in Griffiths:\n\nHow does an approximation (Taylor or Multipole) give us something \"more informative?\" As far as I'm aware, they will result in 0 anyways at a large distance.

Moreover, even after the Taylor Series expansion and the subsequent expression, it still goes to 0 at large z.

But it's going to be messy, and tedious, and not particularly illuminating.\nIs there a better solution? From your time sitting in calculus classes, you may realize that you could approximate these results assuming that $d$ is small. This might provide a nearly equivalent answer which is far simpler to write down, and gives you vastly more insight into the behavior of water molecules.\nIn particular, notice that\n$$(x\\pm d\\cos(\\theta)^2+y^2+(z+d\\sin(\\theta))^2 = x^2+y^2+z^2 \\pm 2xd\\cos(\\theta)+2zd\\sin(\\theta) + d^2$$\n$$\\equiv r^2\\left(1 \\pm \\frac{2xd}{r^2}\\cos(\\theta) + \\frac{2zd}{r^2}\\sin(\\theta) + \\frac{d^2}{r^2}\\right)$$\nTaking the square root and computing the reciprocal yields\n$$\\frac{1}{r}\\left(1 \\mp \\frac{xd}{r^2}\\cos(\\theta) - \\frac{zd}{r^2}\\sin(\\theta)\\right)$$\nwhere we have approximated $(1+ \\ldots)^{-1/2}$ and neglected $d^2/r^2$, which we take to be far smaller than the terms we have kept. Applying this approximation to each term in the nightmare above yields the following:\n$$V(x,y,z) \\approx -\\frac{2q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r} + \\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}\\left(1- \\frac{xd}{r^2}\\cos(\\theta) - \\frac{zd}{r^2}\\sin(\\theta)\\right)$$\n$$+\\frac{q}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}\\left(1 + \\frac{xd}{r^2}\\cos(\\theta) - \\frac{zd}{r^2}\\sin(\\theta)\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{(-2q + q + q)}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r} - \\frac{2qzd\\sin(\\theta)}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^3}$$\nHopefully you agree that this is a vast improvement in clarity. Things are improved further by noting that the first term cancels out because the total charge of the molecule is $-2q+q+q=0$, leaving\n$$V(x,y,z)\\approx \\frac{\\mathbf p \\cdot \\mathbf r}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^3}\\tag{$\\star\\star$}$$\nwhere $\\mathbf p \\equiv -(2q)d\\sin(\\theta) \\hat z$ is the molecule's dipole moment. I'm sure you will agree that $(\\star\\star)$ is vastly preferable to $(\\star)$ both in conceptual clarity and computational efficiency - and for $d\\ll r$, the difference between them is a small fraction of a percent.\nWhat we've actually done is compute the first two terms of the multipole expansion, which formalizes what we did by hand and makes it very efficient. The monopole contribution vanishes because the net charge is zero, but the dipole moment is nonzero and so the second term in the expansion survives (as do others, but they are much smaller at large distances). We can now use it to answer my questions from before:\n\nCan you compute, for example, the torque that this water molecule applies to another which is located at some other position in a different orientation?\n\nSure. The electric field due to the dipole is\n$$\\mathbf E = -\\nabla V = -\\frac{\\mathbf p}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0r^3} + \\frac{3(\\mathbf p \\cdot \\mathbf r)\\mathbf r}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^5}$$\n(have fun calculating that for $(\\star)$). An elementary result tells us that the torque on a second dipole $\\mathbf p'$ is\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf p' \\times \\mathbf E = -\\frac{\\mathbf p'\\times \\mathbf p}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^3} + \\frac{3(\\mathbf p\\cdot \\mathbf r)(\\mathbf p' \\times \\mathbf r)}{4\\pi \\epsilon_0 r^5}$$\n\ncan you tell me how one water molecule interacts with another?\n\nEach water molecule creates an approximate dipole field, and other molecules feel a torque which encourages them to align with that dipole field. Two isolated water molecules will therefore seek to align with one another (this is part of hydrogen bonding), and networks of water molecules will assume a configuration which most effectively aligns them with one another (which results in the crystalline structure of ice).", "meta": {"id": 786488, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 786488, 'input_score': 20, 'output_score': 39, 'post_title': 'Purpose of Using Taylor Series and Multipole Expansion to Approximate Potential'}"}}

Then the PNT states that for fixed $q$ there is\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)\\sim{x\\over\\varphi(q)}.\\tag1\n$$\nWhen $q$ is not fixed, Page (1935) proved the following general result:\nTheorem 1 (Page): There exists some absolute and effective $c_0>0$ such that for all $(a,q)=1$:\n$$\n\\psi(x;q,a)={x\\over\\varphi(q)}-\\color{blue}{{\\chi(a)x^\\beta}\\over\\varphi(q)\\beta}+O\\{xe^{-c_0\\sqrt{\\log x}}\\},\\tag2\n$$\nwhere $\\chi$ denotes the exceptional character and $\\beta$ denotes the Siegel zero. The blue term would be dropped if there are no exceptional characters modulo $q$.\nTo unify the error terms, we require a result due to Siegel (1935):\nTheorem 2 (Siegel): For all $\\varepsilon>0$ there exists some $A_\\varepsilon>0$ such that $1-\\beta>A_\\varepsilon q^{-\\varepsilon}$.\nPlugging this result into the blue term of (2), we have\n$$\nx^\\beta\\ll x e^{-A_\\varepsilon q^{-\\varepsilon}\\log x}.\n$$\nIf $q\\le(\\log x)^{2/\\varepsilon}$, then the right hand side becomes $\\ll xe^{-A_\\varepsilon\\sqrt{\\log x}}$.

{"input": "I want to use use Agda to help me write proofs, but I am getting contradictory feedback about the value of proof relevance.\nJacques Carette wrote a Proof-relevant Category Theory in Agda library. But some seem to think (perhaps here, but I was told elsewhere) that proof relevance can be problematic. 1-Category Theory is supposed to be proof irrelevant (and I guess above two categories, this is no longer the case?) I even heard that one may not get the same results if one uses proof relevant category theory.\nAt the same time I believe the Category Theory in the HoTT book and the implementation in Cubical Agda are proof irrelevant (as the HomSets are Sets, i.e., have only one way of being equal).\nWhen should I be happy to have proof relevance? When should I rather choose a proof irrelevant library or proof assistant? What are the advantages of each? Would proof irrelevance be problematic as I move to two categories?", "output": "There are several possible notions of proof relevance. Let us consider three similar situations:\n\nAn element of a sum $\\Sigma (x : A) . P(x)$ is a pair $(a, p)$ where $a : A$ and $p$ is a proof of $P(a)$.\n\nAn element of $\\Sigma (x : A) . \\|P(x)\\|$, where $\\|{-}\\|$ is propositional truncation, is a pair $(a, q)$ where $a : A$ and $q$ is an equivalence class of proofs of $P(a)$ (where any two proofs of $P(a)$ are considered equivalent).\n\nIn set theory, an element of the subset $\\{x \\in A \\mid \\phi(x)\\}$, where $\\phi(x)$ is a logical formula, is just $a \\in A$ such that $\\phi(a)$ holds.\n\n\nThe first situation is proof relevant because we get full access to the proof $p$, and in particular we may analyze $p$.\nThe third situation is proof irrelevant because we get access just to $a \\in A$ but have no further information as to why $\\phi(a)$ holds, just that it does.\nThe second situation looks like proof irrelevance, but is actually a form of restricted proof relevance: we do not delete the proof of $P(a)$ but just control its uses with truncation. That is, from $q$ we may extract a representative proof $p$ of $P(a)$, so long as the choice of $p$ is irrelevant.\nThere is a cruicial difference between the third and the second situation, for having restricted access to $p$ is not at all the same as not having access at all. Here is a concrete example. Given $f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}$, define\n$$\nZ(f) = \\Sigma(x : \\mathbb{N}) . \\Pi (y : \\mathbb{N}) . \\mathrm{Id}(f(x + y), 0)\n$$\nAn element of $Z(f)$ is a pair $(m, p)$ witnessing the fact that $f(n)$ is zero for all $n \\geq m$. Given $f$ with this property, we want to define the sum $S(f) = f(0) + f(1) + f(2) + \\cdots$, which of course should be a natural number since eventually the terms are all zero. But proof relevance matters:\n\nWe may define $S : (\\Sigma (f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}) . Z(f)) \\to \\mathbb{N}$ by\n$$S(f, (m, p)) = f(0) + \\cdots + f(m)$$\n\nWe may define $S : (\\Sigma (f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}) . \\|Z(f)\\|) \\to \\mathbb{N}$ by\n$$S(f, |(m,p)|) = f(0) + \\cdots + f(m),$$\nwhere $|(m,p)|$ is the truncated witness of $Z(f)$. This is a valid definition because using a different representative $(m',p')$ leads to the same value (as we just end up adding fewer or more zeroes).\n\nImagining that in type theory we had proof irrelevant subset types\n$$\\frac{\\vdash a : A \\qquad \\vdash p : P(a)}{\\vdash a : \\{x : A \\mid P(x)\\}}$$\nwe cannot define $S : \\{f : \\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N} \\mid Z(f)\\} \\to \\mathbb{N}$ because we have no information that would allow us to limit the number of terms $f(0), f(1), f(2), \\ldots$ that need to be added. (There are other things we can do, but that is beside the point here.)\n\n\nAs long as one works in type theory, the only truly proof irrelevant judgements are judgemental equalities. We never define subset types, such as the one above, because that ruins many good properties of type theory (although it would be interesting to investigate this direction).\nIn the old days type theory did not have propositional truncation or any other form of quotienting, and so one was forced to work in a completely proof relevant way all the time. This is unsatisfactory because it fails to capture properly a great deal of mathematical reasoning. People invented setoids to deal with the problem, and later on introduced propositional truncation (and other forms of quotienting).\nYou ask wheter 1-categories are \"proof relevant\". Well, everything in type theory is proof relevant, the only question is how do we deal with having too much proof relevance. Concretely, in a 1-category $\\mathcal{C}$, equality of morphisms $f, g : A \\to B$ should be \"irrelevant\" in the sense that it never matter how $f$ and $g$ are equal, only that they are. In HoTT this is expressed by requiring that $\\mathrm{Id}(f,g)$ have at most one element, which amounts to\n$\\mathrm{Hom}_\\mathcal{C}(A,B)$ being an h-set.\nIn setoid-based formulations of category theory, one needs to account for this phenomenon in some other way, or else one is secretly doing something other than 1-category theory.

The figure below illustrates the case $n = 5$:\n\nThe solution is straightforward.  The right triangle shown in the diagram has legs $r-1$ and $r-(2n-1)$, and hypotenuse $r+1$.  Therefore, $$(r-1)^2 + (r-2n+1)^2 = (r+1)^2,$$ from which it follows that $$r = (1 + \\sqrt{2n})^2.$$  For $n = 2$, this gives $r = 9$ and the side length of the square is $18$.  For $n = 5$, we have $r = 11 + 2 \\sqrt{10}$.  Whenever $n$ is twice a square, i.e. $n = 2m^2$ for a positive integer $m$, then $r = (1 + 2m)^2$ is also an integer and the circumscribing square has integer sides.\n\nAs a related but different question, given $n$ such circles, what is the total number of externally tangent unit circles that can be placed in the corner such that their centers form a square lattice and do not intersect the large circle?  So for $n = 2$, this number is $f(n) = 3$ as shown in your figure.  For $n = 5$, it is $f(5) = 12$.", "meta": {"id": 3691332, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 3691332, 'input_score': 61, 'output_score': 44, 'post_title': 'What is the size of each side of the square?'}"}}

{"input": "In a first course in linear algebra, it is common for instructors to mostly restrict their attention to finite-dimensional vector spaces. These vector spaces are usually not assumed to be equipped with any additional structure, such as an inner product, norm, or a topology. On the other hand, it seems that when infinite-dimensional vector spaces are encountered in later courses, it is much more common to equip with them additional structure. Why is this? A partial answer might be that infinite-dimensional vector spaces are often studied in functional analysis, where extra structure is needed to properly define analytical concepts such as infinite series. However, I would have expected that \"pure\" infinite-dimensional vector spaces have a use in some area of mathematics.\nI have now also asked this on MathOverflow.", "output": "Consider the following example.\nVectors over, say, the field $\\mathbb{R}$, with finite dimension $n$, we'd like to prototypically understand as lists, or tuples:\n$$\\mathbf{v} = (a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n).$$\nNote here that the right hand is literally a tuple of reals; it is the \"meat\" of what the objects in the space \"$\\mathbb{R}^n$\" \"really are\". The reals $a_j$ are the components of the vector, which are not the same concept as coordinates, which refer to the values $b_j$ when $\\mathbf{v}$ is expressed in a basis $\\mathcal{B}$:\n$$\\mathbf{v} = b_1 \\mathbf{b}_1 + b_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 + \\cdots + b_n \\mathbf{b}_n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{B} = \\{ \\mathbf{b}_1, \\mathbf{b}_2, \\cdots, \\mathbf{b}_n \\}$. Given a basis, any vector has coordinates, but not all vectors have components, because the elements of the actual vector space set need not be just tuples.\nBut here's the thing: it's quite obvious that, in this case, we have a basis where that the coordinates and components are identical, namely:\n$$\\begin{matrix}\n\\mathbf{e}_1 := (1, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0)\\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_2 := (0, 1, 0, \\cdots, 0)\\\\\n\\cdots\\\\\n\\mathbf{e}_n := (0 ,0, 0, \\cdots, 1)\\end{matrix}$$\nThen the vector $(a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_n) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j \\mathbf{e}_j$ and the coordinates and components are identical. We call this the standard basis for $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nNow, consider infinite dimension.

{"input": "There is apparently cutting-edge research by Dustin Clausen & Peter Scholze (and probably others) under the name Condensed Mathematics, which is meant to show that the notion of Topological Space is not so well-chosen, and that Condensed Sets lead to better behaved structures.\n\nWhat is a simple low-tech example to see the difference?\n\nI am looking for some explicit construction with quite simple topological spaces where some bad behaviour occur, and how their condensed analog fix that.\nI am aware of the nlab entry and of an introductory text by F. Deglise on this page but it goes quite far too quickly and I am missing knowledge to grasp it.", "output": "Here's a one-paragraph answer: Topological spaces formalize the idea of spaces with a notion of \"nearness\" of points. However, they fail to handle the idea of \"points that are infinitely near, but distinct\" in a useful way. Condensed sets handle this idea in a useful way.\nLet me give a few examples. Say you have a nice space like the line $X=\\mathbb R$, and acting on it you have a group $G$. If $G$ acts nicely, for example $G=\\mathbb Z$ through translations, then the quotient space $X/G$ is well-behaved as a topological space, giving the circle $S^1$ in this case. However, if $G$ has dense orbits, for example $G=\\mathbb Q$, then $X/G$ is not well-behaved as a topological space. In fact, in this example $\\mathbb R/\\mathbb Q$ has many distinct points, but they are all infinitely near: any neighborhood of one point $x$ will also contain any other point $y$. Thus, as a topological space $\\mathbb R/\\mathbb Q$ is indiscrete; in other words, it is not remembering any nontrivial topological structure.\nOne could also consider nonabelian examples, like the quotient $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb R)/\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb Z[\\tfrac 12])$.\nSimilar things also happen in functional analysis. For example, one can embed summable sequences\n$$\\ell^1(\\mathbb N)=\\{(x_n)_n\\mid x_n\\in \\mathbb R, \\sum_n |x_n|<\\infty\\}$$\ninto square-summable sequences\n$$\\ell^2(\\mathbb N)=\\{(x_n)_n\\mid x_n\\in \\mathbb R, \\sum_n |x_n|^2<\\infty\\}$$\nand consider the quotient $\\ell^2(\\mathbb N)/\\ell^1(\\mathbb N)$. As a topological vector space, this is indiscrete, and so has no further structure than the abstract $\\mathbb R$-vector space. For this reason, quotients of this type are usually avoided, although they may come up naturally!\nWithout repeating the definition of condensed sets here, let me just advertise that they can formalize the idea of \"points that are infinitely close, but distinct\", and all the above quotients can be taken in condensed sets and are reasonable. As we have seen, this means that one must abandon \"neighborhoods\" as the primitive concept, as in these examples all neighborhoods of one point already contain all other points. Roughly, what is formalized instead is the notion of convergence, possibly allowing that one sequence converges in several different ways.\nSo in the condensed world, it becomes possible to consider quotients like $\\ell^2(\\mathbb N)/\\ell^1(\\mathbb N)$, and inside all condensed $\\mathbb R$-vector spaces they are about as strange as torsion abelian groups like $\\mathbb Z/2\\mathbb Z$ are inside all abelian groups. However, there are some surprising new phenomena: For example, there is a nonzero map of condensed $\\mathbb R$-vector spaces\n$$\\ell^1(\\mathbb N)\\to \\ell^2(\\mathbb N)/\\ell^1(\\mathbb N)$$\ninduced by the map\n$$(x_n)_n\\mapsto (x_n \\log |x_n|)_n,$$\nin other words $x\\mapsto x\\log |x|$ pretends to be a linear map! (Let me leave this as a (fun) exercise.)\n(These are liquid $\\mathbb R$-vector spaces, and the presence of such strange maps makes it hard to set up the basic theory of liquid vector spaces; but arguably makes it more interesting!)", "meta": {"id": 4044728, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 4044728, 'input_score': 24, 'output_score': 68, 'post_title': 'Examples of the difference between Topological Spaces and Condensed Sets'}"}}

The end limit might be $X$, or it might not; to show $X$ complete is to show that the end limit is in fact in $X$.\nFor this reason, $Z$ is called the completion of $X$.\nWith that said, some space is much more general than you give it credit for.\nGiven your notation ($f_n\\to f$), I think you assumed that the limit of a Cauchy sequence of functions is itself a function.  Probably $X$ was the space of continuous functions under the uniform norm, and so you thought that you just had to prove $f$ was itself a continuous function.\nBut $f$ could be far worse!  For example, let $X$ be the space of continuous functions on $[0,1]$ with the following norm: $$d_1(f,g)=\\int_0^1{|f(x)-g(x)|\\,dx}$$  Then $X$ has a well-known completion: $L^1([0,1])$, the space of Lebesgue-integrable functions on $[0,1]$, up to a.e. equivalence.\nIf you haven't seen the Lebesgue integral, don't worry; the pathology carries over to Riemann-integrable functions.  In particular, one can show that any piecewise-continuous function lies in the equivalent of $(Y;d_2)$ (to borrow notation from above).[*]  So, for any $r$, the function $\\delta_r$ where $$\\delta_r(x)=\\begin{cases}r&x=0\\\\0&x\\neq0\\end{cases}$$  is in $Y$.\nBut all those functions collapse to the same point in $(Z;d_2)$.  That is, given any convergent sequence $f_n$, we can find some $f_{\\infty}$ such that $f_n\\to f_{\\infty}$\u2026and $f_n\\to f_{\\infty}+\\delta_r$ too!\nSo we can't define an evaluation map to describe $f_{\\infty}(0)$.  Indeed, for any fixed point $x$, $f_{\\infty}(x)$ is not well-defined.\n[*]: As Noiralef pointed out in comments, I'm cheating here.  I previously defined $Y$ as an equivalence set of Cauchy sequences; now I'm saying a function $\\delta_r$ is in $Y$.  What I mean here is, there exists a (uniformly bounded) Cauchy sequence of continuous functions converging pointwise to $\\delta_r$.", "meta": {"id": 4273341, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 4273341, 'input_score': 80, 'output_score': 91, 'post_title': 'Does every Cauchy sequence converge to *something*, just possibly in a different space?'}"}}

A common argument goes something like: \"If you believe $\\mathsf{PA}$ formalizes valid reasoning about arithmetic, then you believe what it proves. Hence it cannot prove $\\mathsf{0=1}$, because $0$ is not really equal to $1$. Hence you believe $\\mathsf{PA}$ is consistent.\" But I think this argument would be more secure if it didn't rest on definite facts about \"true arithmetic,\" and in particular the assumption that \"$0$ is not actually equal to $1$,\" but instead referred only to $\\mathsf{BA}$.

Looking at the formal definition of \u201cfunction\u201d will help make clear some of the unusual cases such as functions with empty domains.\nA function from $A$ to $B$ can be understood as a set of pairs $$\\langle a,b\\rangle$$ where $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$.  And:\n\nThere must be exactly one pair $\\langle a,b\\rangle$ for each element $a$ of $A$.\n\nExactly one, no more and no less, or the set of pairs is not a function.\nFor example, the function that takes an integer $n$ and yields its square $n^2$ can be understood as the (infinite) set of ordered pairs:\n$$\\{ \\ldots ,\\langle -2, 4\\rangle,\n\\langle -1, 1\\rangle,\n\\langle 0, 0\\rangle ,\\langle 1, 1\\rangle,\n\\langle 2, 4\\rangle\\ldots\\}$$\nAnd for each integer $n$ there is exactly one pair $\\langle n, n^2\\rangle$.  Some numbers can be missing on the right side (for example, there is no pair $\\langle n, 3\\rangle$) and some numbers can be repeated on the right (for example the function contains both $\\langle -2, 4\\rangle$\nand $\\langle 2, 4\\rangle$) but on the left each number appears exactly once.\n\nNow suppose $A$ is some set $\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots\\}$ and $B$ is a set with only one element $\\{b\\}$.  What does a function from $A$ to $B$ look like?  There is only one possible function: it must be: $$\\{\n\\langle a_1, b\\rangle,\n\\langle a_2, b\\rangle,\n\\ldots\\}.$$ There is no choice about the left-side elements of the pairs, because there must be exactly one pair for each element of $A$.  There is also no choice about the right-side element of each pair.  $B$ has only one element, $b$, so the right-side element of each pair must be $b$.\nSo, if $B$ is a one-element set, there is exactly one function from $A$ to $B$. This is the definition of \u201cterminal\u201d, and one-element sets are terminal.\nNow what if it's $A$ that has only one element?  We have $A=\\{a\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots\\}$.  How many functions are there now?  Only one?\nOne function is $$\\{\\langle a, b_1\\rangle\\}$$\nanother is $$\\{\\langle a, b_2\\rangle\\}$$\nand another is $$\\{\\langle a, b_3\\rangle\\}$$\nand so on.  Each function is a set of pairs where the left-side elements come from $A$, and each element of $A$ is in exactly one pair.  $A$ has only one element, so there can only be one pair in each function.  Still, the functions are all different.\nYou said:\n\nI would find it more intuitive if one-element set would be initial object too.\n\nBut for a one-element set $A$ to be initial, there must be exactly one function $A\\to B$ for each $B$.  And we see above that usually there are many functions $A\\to B$.\n\nNow we do functions on the empty set.  Suppose $A$ is $\\{a_1, a_2, \\ldots\\}$ and $B$ is empty.  What does a function from $A\\to B$ look like?  It must be a set of pairs, it must have exactly one pair for each element of $a$, and the right-side of each pair must be an element of $B$. But $B$ has no elements, so this is impossible:  $$\\{\\langle a_1, ?\\rangle, \\langle a_2, ?\\rangle, \\ldots\\}.$$\nThere is nothing to put on the right side of the pairs.  So there are no functions $A\\to\\varnothing$.   (There is one exception to this claim, which we will see in a minute.)\nWhat if $A$ is empty and $B$ is not, say $\\{b_1, b_2, \\ldots\\}$?  A  function $A\\to B$ is a set of pairs that has exactly one pair for each element of $A$.  But $A$ has no elements.  No problem, the function has no pairs! $$\\{\\}$$\nA function is a set of pairs, and the set can be empty.  This is called the \u201cempty function\u201d.  When $A$ is the empty set, there is exactly one function from $A\\to B$, the empty function, no matter what $B$ is.  This is the definition of \u201cinitial\u201d, so the empty set is initial.\nDoes the empty set have an identity morphism?  It does; the empty function $\\{ \\}$ is its identity morphism.  This is the one exception to the claim that there are no functions from $A\\to\\varnothing$: if $A$ is also empty, the empty function is such a function, the only one.\n\nThe issue for topological spaces is exactly the same:\n\nWhen $B$ has only one element, there is exactly one continuous map  $A\\to B$ for every $A$.\nWhen $A$ is empty, there is exactly one continuous map $A\\to B$ for every $B$: the empty function is the unique map.\nWhen $A$ has only one element, there are usually many continuous maps $A\\to B$, one different one for each element of $B$.\n\nThere are categories in which the initial and terminal objects are the same.

If I want to motivate their definition, I sort of naturally go through the following implications in my head:\n\nto study a problem over the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ (or more generally, the ring of integers of a number field) the strategy is to localise the problem at a prime $p$, as to focus around it and worry about the problem 'one point at a time', so-to-speak;\nwe (literally, now) localise at the prime $p$, just as one would do with the ring of regular functions on a variety, and replace $\\mathbb{Z}$ with the ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)} := \\{ \\frac{x}{y} \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\mid p\\nmid y \\}$ ;\nwe can then complete at the maximal ideal $(p) \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ to obtain the $p$-adic integers $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, with the benefit that now there's access to approximation techniques such as Hensel's lemma, and the newly obtained ring has pretty much all the same algebraic properties as $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ because of its identical valuation theory.\n\nIt's this last step which still confuses me... even though I can appreciate the utility of approximation techniques, it still feels extremely arbitrary why it turns out to be so inevitable with all the theory that builds upon this measly little step. Somehow, every time I've seen the study of formal neighbourhoods in algebraic geometry it always feels like it's a tool to tackle a problem, and not the main object of study, whereas in my head the $p$-adic numbers have turned out to be the main character in many areas of mathematics, which sort-of goes against this intuition of mine I find.\nSince this intuition really doesn't come from any of my teachers and I'm not quite sure it makes much sense, I wanted to ask if it's an apt way to think about the use of non-archimedean fields in mathematics; I'd also be very interested in learning about their role in the history of algebraic number theory since I'm not quite sure I can properly place their use and introduction on a timeline in a coherent way with all of the theory I have in mind.\nI apologise if my question is very hand-wavy, and I'd be super grateful for any sort of insight :) Thank you very much for your time!!", "output": "Let me explain how I think about one way in which $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ (or more to the point $\\mathbb{Z}_p$) appears from an arithmetic-geometric perspective.

For a perspective more in-line with that discussed by the user hunter you can look at these old notes of mine [Disclaimer: these are quite old and so I can't vouch for their correctness, mathematically of philosophically])\n\nThe general motivation\nThe basic idea stems from the following credo which one encounters ad nauseam in their mathematical education.

For instance, it's a good exercise to think how one might put the first example in this form!\n\nOf course, this idea really only works with the following serious caveat: the local 'geometry' of $X$ is simple(r) enough to make solving the problem locally on $X$ (more) tenable.\nA geometric perspective of solving equations\nSo, how does this relate to solving Diophantine equations or, for that matter, your question?\nThe beautiful idea of Grothendieck and his collaborators (building off of the work of many others) shows that solving equations can, in fact, be put into the context of (Sect). Namely, there is associated to any ring $R$ a geometric object $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, a so-called locally ringed space (the category of which we shall denote $\\mathbf{LRS}$), such that\n$$\\mathbf{Ring}\\to \\mathbf{LRS},\\qquad R\\mapsto \\mathrm{Spec}(R)$$\nis a (contravariant) fully faithful embedding. This is a bit abstract, so before we explain how this relates to solving equations, let us spell this out a little more precisely.\nThe object $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, being a locally ringed space, means it comes with two bits of structure:\n\nan underlying topological space and,\na 'sheaf of functions' $\\mathcal{O}$ which assigns to any open subset $U$ the ring $\\mathcal{O}(U)$ of 'functions on $U$'.\n\nThe underlying topological space $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ can be described very explicitly. As a set we take\n$$\\mathrm{Spec}(R)=\\{\\mathfrak{p}\\subseteq R\\text{ a prime ideal}\\}.$$\nThe topology on $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, called the Zariski topology, has (a basis of) open subsets given by the non-vanishing loci\n$$D(f):=\\{\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\mathrm{Spec}(R):f\\notin\\mathfrak{p}\\}$$\nfor an element $f$ of $R$. To help understand the intuition behind the terminology 'non-vanishing locus', it is helpful to think about the defining property of $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$: $R=\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{Spec}(R))$; in other words, the ring of functions on $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ is $R$.\nTo understand this, let us first think of the example $R=\\mathbb{C}[x]$. Here we have\n$$ \\{(x-p):p\\in\\mathbb{C}\\}\\cup\\{(0)\\}= \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[x])\\supseteq \\mathrm{MaxSpec}(\\mathbb{C}[x])=\\{(x-p):p\\in\\mathbb{C}\\},$$\nwhere for a ring $R$ we write $\\mathrm{MaxSpec}(R)$ for the set of maximal ideals of $R$. Note then that any element $f$ in $\\mathbb{C}[x]$ can be thought of as a function\n$$f\\colon\\mathrm{MaxSpec}(\\mathbb{C}[x])\\to \\mathbb{C},\\qquad (x-p)\\mapsto (f\\bmod (x-p))=f(p),$$\nwhere this last identification is using the isomorphism $\\mathbb{C}[x]/(x-p)\\cong \\mathbb{C}$.\nNow for a general ring $R$ (especially those rings that will show up in our study of Diophantine equations), we don't have the luxury of their maximal ideals admitting such a geometric description. In fact, in general, we don't even have the luxury of having enough maximal ideals for $\\mathrm{MaxSpec}(R)$ to be a particularly useful set (e.g. for a local ring there is only one!). That said, we may use the above example as a hint of how to think of an element $f$ of $R$ as a function on $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$: it is the assignment\n$$f\\colon \\mathrm{Spec}(R)\\longrightarrow \\bigsqcup_{\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\mathrm{Spec}(R)}k(\\mathfrak{p}),\\qquad \\mathfrak{p}\\mapsto f(\\mathfrak{p}):=(f\\bmod \\mathfrak{p})\\qquad (\\ast).$$\nHere $k(\\mathfrak{p}):=\\mathrm{Frac}(R/\\mathfrak{p})$ is the 'residue field' of $R$ at $\\mathfrak{p}$.\nThis might look quite bizarre, especially the codomain being a big disjoint union of different fields. But, the fact that this didn't occur in the case $R=\\mathbb{C}[x]$ is semi-coincidental: for every $\\mathfrak{p}$ in $\\mathrm{MaxSpec}(\\mathbb{C}[x])$ there is an isomorphism $k(\\mathfrak{p})\\cong\\mathbb{C}$ and so we (sort of carelessly) identified them all with each other. As intimated before, such happy coincidences don't happen in general, and so we're stuck with the above. But, if you buy this interpretation, then the phrase 'non-vanishing locus' makes sense, as $D(f)$ is exactly those $\\mathfrak{p}$ for which $f(\\mathfrak{p})\\ne 0$.\nBut, I told you that a locally ringed space also came with a sheaf $\\mathcal{O}$ of functions -- what is it for $\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$? For formal reasons (because they form a basis) it suffices to describe the value of $\\mathcal{O}(D(f))$, and the guess is now clear: the only new functions that should be introduced by considering the non-vanishing locus of $f$ is the function $f^{-1}$. Thus, one sets $\\mathcal{O}(D(f))=R[\\tfrac{1}{f}]$.\nThen, at least in very broad terms, the promised (contravariant) fully faithful embedding is manifested as a natural bijection\n$$\\mathrm{Hom}_\\mathbf{Ring}(R,S)=\\mathrm{Hom}_\\mathbf{LRS}(\\mathrm{Spec}(S),\\mathrm{Spec}(R)) \\quad (\\ast\\ast).$$\nThis bijection can be made very explicit, but since I am not even telling you what a morphism of locally ringed spaces is, let's just take it as a black box.\nTwo important examples to keep in mind for the discussion below are:\n\nthe natural map $R\\to R[\\tfrac{1}{f}]$ corresponds to a map $\\mathrm{Spec}(R[\\tfrac{1}{f}])\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ which is an isomorphism onto the open subset $D(f)$ (an 'open immersion'),\nfor a prime $\\mathfrak{p}$ the composition $R\\to\n   R/\\mathfrak{p}\\hookrightarrow k(\\mathfrak{p})$ corresponds to a map\n$\\mathrm{Spec}(k(\\mathfrak{p}))\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(R)$ which one should think of as picking out the point $\\mathfrak{p}$,\n\nOK, fine, how does this help us solve equations? Well, let us fix an $n$-tuple of polynomials\n$$\\mathbf{f}=(f_1,\\ldots,f_m)\\in R[x_1,\\ldots,x_n].$$\nWe may consider the solution set functor for $\\mathbf{f}$ over $S$:\n$$X_\\mathbf{f}\\colon \\{R\\text{-algebras}\\}\\to \\mathbf{Set},$$\ngiven by\n$$X_\\mathbf{f}(S):=\\{(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)\\in S^n: f_j(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)=0\\text{ for }j=1,\\ldots,m\\}.$$\nIn other words, $X_\\mathbf{f}(S)$ just spits out the solution set to $\\mathbf{f}=0$ over $S$. On the other hand, note that there is a natural bijection between $X_\\mathbf{f}(S)$ and the $S$-algebra maps\n$$\\alpha\\colon S[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(f_1,\\ldots,f_m)\\to S$$\ngiven by sending $\\alpha$ to the $n$-tuple $(\\alpha(x_1),\\ldots,\\alpha(x_n))$.\nSo, formally studying $(\\ast\\ast)$ shows the following beautiful fact: there is a natural bijection\n$$X_\\mathbf{f}(S)\\longleftrightarrow \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\\text{Sections of the map}\\\\ \\mathrm{Spec}(S[x_i]/(f_j))\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(S)\\end{matrix}\\right\\}.$$\nIf you buy the above, then the upshot is that by taking $R=S=\\mathbb{Z}$, then we can squarely (if surprisingly) place solving Diophantine equations in the setting of the archetypal problem (Sect) from above with $X=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$\nBefore we get too excited though, we need to recall the aforementioned caveat: all of this formalism is useful if the local geometry of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is simple enough. Well...what is the local geometry of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$. Or, an even more prescient question...what does local even mean?\nWell, there is a natural guess. After all $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a topological space, so 'local' should mean studying a 'sufficiently small' open neighborhood. Now, we know what the set $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ looks like:\n$$\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})=\\{(p):p\\text{ is a prime}\\}\\cup\\{(0)\\}.$$\nA little thought even allows us to describe the Zariski open sets. Namely, the proper non-empty open subsets of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ are of the form\n$$\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})-\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_n\\}$$\nfor primes $p_1,\\ldots,p_n$.\nThe Zariski topology is strange. It's quite feeble (coarse). These open subsets are all just too big to somehow serve as a 'sufficiently small' neighborhood of a point $(p)$. As an analogy, for the space $\\mathbb{C}$ (with its usual topology) and a point $p\\in\\mathbb{C}$, we think of the 'sufficiently small' open neighborhoods of $p$ to be of the form $p\\in\\mathbb{D}\\subseteq\\mathbb{C}$ where $\\mathbb{D}$ is an open disc. In particular, we very much do not think of the open subsets $\\mathbb{C}-\\{p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\}$ for points $p_1,\\ldots,p_m\\in\\mathbb{C}$ as being small.\nAgain, let me emphasize, while $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is a powerful object, its topology (the Zariski topology) is somewhat feeble(=coarse).\nRemark 2:\n\nOne equational justification for why no neighborhood $D(f)$ of $(p)$ is sufficiently small: for any prime $p\\ne q\\nmid f$, the equation $qx=1$ does NOT have a solution in $\\mathbb{Z}[\\tfrac{1}{f}]$. A 'sufficiently small' neighborhood of $(p)$ should not have equational obstructions coming from other points!\n\nWell, if no one Zariski open neighborhood of $(p)$ is small enough, you can do something even more drastic: what if we intersect all the neighborhoods. In normal topology land this is not a very reasonable thing to do -- for a Hausdorff topological space you just get the point back! But, the upside of the feebleness of the Zariski topology of $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is that this is a reasonable operation here. In fact, inspecting $(\\ast\\ast)$, and the fact that it reverses the direction of maps, we might guess that\n$$\\bigcap_{p\\in D(f)}D(f)=\\varprojlim_{p\\in D(f)}D(f),$$\nshould be a geometric space with ring of functions\n$$\\varinjlim_{f\\notin (p)}\\mathbb{Z}[\\tfrac{1}{f}]=\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}.$$\nAnd so, in fact, a good model for the 'intersection of all neighborhoods of $(p)$' is $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$. Maybe this is a \"neighborhood\" which is 'sufficiently small'.\nUnfortunately, this is still not small enough (a true indictment of the Zariski topology). The reason for this is more subtle, and takes a bit more of a leap-of-faith in terms of geometric philosophy. Namely, if $U$ is to be a 'sufficiently small neighborhood' of $(p)$ then we would imagine that the map\n$$\\{(p)\\}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}),$$\nshould be something like a (weak) homotopy equivalence. One of the main reasons that a small open disk around $p$ in $\\mathbb{C}$ is often 'sufficiently small' in complex analysis is because it's contractible. Unfortunately, this is not the case. In fact, in a way that one can make precise the map on fundamental groups isn't even an isomorphism.\nRemark 3:\n\nIt takes a lot of faith that this topological wording can be made precise and...wait a minute...even if you can, what in the world does this have to do with solving Diophantine equations? Let me try to give an example which hopefully (mildly) addresses both of these points.  Let us consider the Diophantine equation $$\\{y\\in\\mathbb{Z}:y^2+y+1=0.\\}$$ From our above discussion we know that this should correspond to studying sections of the map $$\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2+x+1))\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}).$$ Moreover, what it should mean to study this 'locally at $(13)$', with $\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)}$ as our meaning of local, is that we want to study sections of the map $$\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)}[x]/(x^2+x+1))\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)}).$$ That said, while this map does not have a section it does have a section over the point $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$: $$y^2+y+1=0\\bmod 13$$ has two distinct solutions.  Why is this indictative of the fact that $$\\{(13)\\}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_{13})\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)})$$ is not a homotopy equivalence? Well, let us note that the map $$\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)}[x]/(x^2+x+1))\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)}).$$ can/should be thought of as being smooth and proper: smooth because its derivative $2x+1$ vanishes nowhere on $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)}[x]/(x^2+x+1))$, and proper because it's finite. That said, Ehresmann's theorem says that a smooth proper map is locally trivial fibration. If $X'\\to X$ is a (weak) homotopy equivalence and $Y\\to X$ is a locally trivial fibration, then it should have a section if and only if $Y\\times_X X'\\to X'$ has a section. Thus, this indicates that $$\\{(13)\\}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_{13})\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(13)})$$ is indeed not a homotopy equivalence.  As mentioned above this remark, for those in the know, what I am really pointing out here is that the map $$\\pi_1^\\mathrm{et}(\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p))\\to\\pi_1(\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)})$$ is not a bijection.\n\nThe idea of Grothendieck and his collaborators/descendants is the following: because the Zariski topology on $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is too feeble, one should replace it with a sort of \"generalized topology\" where one can take 'sufficiently small neighborhoods' of points. I won't attempt to define \"generalized topology\", but in our case what pops out is the Nisnevich topology on $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$, which acts in a manner much more similar to the usual topology on $\\mathbb{C}$.\nRemark 4:\n\n For those more in the know, you might be surprised that what is showing up here is the Nisnevich topology, and not the more common etale topology. The reason is that unlike the case of $\\mathbb{C}$, our points themselves have non-trivial topology. In fact, recall that $$\\pi_1^\\mathrm{et}(\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p))=\\mathrm{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_p/\\mathbb{F}_p)\\cong\\widehat{\\mathbb{Z}}.$$ The Nisnevich topology respects that, and allows you to zoom in on $(p)$ without altering the topology of the point. The etale neighborhood, on the other hand, pursues the logical conclusion by zooming in so far as to obtain a 'contractible' neighborhood, but at the cost of altering the topology of the point. Both are useful, but for our purposes here it is the Nisnevich topology playing the more crucial role.\n\nIn particular, one can again 'intersect all neighborhoods' of $(p)$ in this more robust Nisnevich topology, arriving at the Henselization of $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$. One may roughly think of this as adding in the minimal number of things to $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ so that Hensel's lemma works (thus the name!). The map\n$$\\{(p)\\}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h),$$\nis like a (weak) homotopy equivalence, and so from a 'topological perspective' this does serve as a 'sufficiently small' neighborhood of $(p)$.\nRemark 5:\n\n My claim that $$\\{(p)\\}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h),$$ is like a (weak) homotopy equivalence is meant to be mostly intuitive, and probably only should be taken seriously at the pro-finite level. That said, see this, this, and Theorem 2.1.6 of this for why $\\mathrm{Spec}(A/I)$ and $\\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ are quite 'topologically similar' for a Henselian pair $(A,I)$. It is also helpful to compare this with the strict Henselization $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^\\mathrm{sh}$, the local ring in the etale topology, where the results are more clear-cut: see this and Proposition 8.6 of Friedlander's Etale homotopy of schemes.\n\nOne 'equational' way this manifests itself is that if $\\mathbf{f}$ defines a 'smooth family at $p$' (i.e. that $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}[x_i]/(f_j))\\to \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ is smooth at $p$), and so topologically well-behaved, then for any $n\\geqslant 1$ the map\n$$X_\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h)\\to X(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}),$$\n(note that $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h/p^n\\mathbb{Z}^h_{(p)}=\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}=\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$ by this) is surjective. In other words, for topologically well-behaved families, the only obstruction to having solutions is coming from the point $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ itself.\nThe ring $\\mathbb{Z}_p$\nNow, this Henselization step does not occur in the situation of $\\mathbb{C}$, essentially for the reason that its topology is much richer. More precisely, for a point $p$ in $\\mathbb{C}$, one has the ring\n$$\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle :=\\varinjlim_{p\\in U}\\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\\text{holomorphic functions}\\\\ U\\to \\mathbb{C}\\end{matrix}\\right\\}$$\nof power series $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i(x-p)^i$ which converge in a neighborhood of $p$. This is a Henselian local ring, with maximal ideal $(x-p)$! Again, we already knew the topology was rich enough to get 'sufficiently small' topological neighborhoods in this case, in the form of small open disks. But, there is one way in which these small open disks are not sufficient, and this will foretell how we will finally alter $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$.\nTo understand this, let us go back to (Diff). Solving a differential equation $Df=0$ where $f$ is an entire function on $\\mathbb{C}$, can be studied by first trying to solve this equation locally at $p$. One way of interpreting this is as solving $Df=0$ for $f$ in $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle$. But, in practice, we quite often actually break this step further into two easier pieces:\n\nfirst solve $Df=0$ for $f\\in\\mathbb{C}[\\![x-p]\\!]$ (i.e. arbitrary power series at $p$ with no convergence conditions),\nthen show that this solution has reasonable convergence properties (i.e. that the solution can be taken to lie in $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle$).\n\nThe hallmark advantage of solving differential equations in $\\mathbb{C}[\\![x-p]\\!]$ is that it has a 'formal solvability criterion': a solution exists if and only if one can find a polynomial solution which approximates it arbitrarily well. We can represent this equationally as\n$$\\{f\\in\\mathbb{C}[\\![x-p]\\!] : Df=0\\}=\\varprojlim_n \\{g_n\\in\\mathbb{C}[x]_n: Dg_n=0\\},$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{C}[x]_n$ is the set of polynomials of degree at most $n-1$. This reduces us to the purely algebraic study of 'finite-like' objects $\\mathbb{C}[x]_n$. Again, the motto here is that while $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle$ has no 'topological obstructions' to reducing study to $\\mathbb{C}[x]_n$, it does have analytic obstructions and $\\mathbb{C}[\\![x]\\!]$ does away with those.\nTo understand what the analagous picture is for $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$, we observe that $\\mathbb{C}[x]_n$ is nothing but $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle /(x-p)^n$: the quotient of this Henselian local ring by the $n^\\text{th}$ power of its maximal ideal. As, essentially by definition,\n$$\\mathbb{C}[\\![x-p]\\!]=\\varprojlim_n \\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle/(x-p)^n,$$\n(mirroring what showed up in formal solvability criterion). Thus, the correct analogue for $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$, with maximal ideal $(p)$, is\n$$\\mathbb{Z}_p=\\varprojlim_n \\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h/p^n\\mathbb{Z}^h_{(p)}=\\varprojlim_n \\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}=\\varprojlim_n \\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}.$$\nThe $p$-adic integers have appeared.\nWhat is the analogue of the formal solvability criterion here? Well, it is simply that one has the equality\n$$X_\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbb{Z}_p)=\\varprojlim_n X_\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}),$$\nsomething that fails with $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ replaced by $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$, essentially for 'convergence' reasons. Thus, our 'formal solvability criterion' again reduces us to studying equations in the 'finite-like' rings $\\mathbb{Z}/p^n\\mathbb{Z}$.\nSummary and original question\nTo summarize the above, we see that by using algebraic geometry to view Diophantine equations geometrically, the guiding principle given in (Sect) led us to\n\nconsider $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ as a possible 'sufficiently small neighborhood' of $(p)$, and to realize it's woefully 'too big',\nto consider the Henselization $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$ to eliminate 'topological obstructions' (not coming from $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ itself) to finding solutions of equations and realizing that it does that job quite well,\nbut to realize that 'analytic' obstructions remain and so we can further replace it with $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ which is a more 'formal' object  (analogous to replacing convergent power series with all power series).\n\nHopefully this is satisfying, and convinces you why rings like $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ are ubiquitious as studying the 'local geometry' at $p$ of $\\mathbb{Z}$ (in different perspectives of 'local').\nI think four questions remain though:\n\nCan one actually work backward from $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$? The answer, astoundingly, is almost always yes. This is the theory of Artin approximation.\nCan one actually work backward from $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$ to an honest Nisnevich neighborhood? The answer again is essentially yes -- see this.\nOK, but can you finally profitably glue these solutions together to an actual Diophantine solution? This is the million dollar question, and the hardest. The answer is a resounding yes...sometimes. As the gluing data can be quite abstract/complicated, it's hard to enact this in practice (although it theoretically always works). Instead people often times consider 'local solutions' with some sort of 'weakened gluing data' (sometimes no gluing data at all!). These usually go under the heading of 'local-to-global principles', and generally have reasonable success.\nWhy use $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ instead of $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$? This is fair question. Hopefully the above gives you some sort of idea of what the advantages of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ are, but from a more literal gluing perspective $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$ is superior. I can imagine a world, not so far from our own (maybe a future world?) where we do use $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$ instead. In fact, I think that some of the work of Fujiwara and Kato (on 'Henselian rigid geometry') can be seen to point in that direction.\n\nAppendix: a description of $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$\nA natural question you might have while reading the above: what does $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$ even look like.\nLet me give a description of $R^h$ in a much more general setting. Suppose that $R$ is a local, Noetherian, excellent integral domain with maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$. This includes many examples, but in particular includes the case when $R$ is a DVR with fraction field of characteristic $0$ (e.g. $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$).\nFor an $R$-algebra $S$, let us define the algebraic closure of $R$ in $S$ to be those $s$ in $S$ which satisfy a non-zero polynomial $p(x)$ in $R[x]$ (NB: there is no assumption that $p(x)$ is monic!).\n\nFact: The Henselization of $R$ is the algebraic closure of $R$ in $\\widehat{R}$.\n\nProof: The map $R\\to R^h$ is local, and in fact $\\mathfrak{m}R^h$ is the maximal ideal of $R^h$ and the map $R/\\mathfrak{m}^nR \\to R^h/\\mathfrak{m}^n R^h$ is an isomorphism for all $n$. Thus, whe natural map $\\widehat{R}\\to \\widehat{R^h}$ is an isomorphism, and so $R^h\\to \\widehat{R^h}=\\widehat{R}$ is faithfully flat, and so injective. We claim that the image of $R^h\\to \\widehat{R}$ consists precisely of those elements of $\\widehat{R}$ which are algebraic over $R$. By definition, if $r$ is an element of $R^h$, then there exists a factorization $R\\to S\\to R^h$, with $R\\to S$ an etale map of local rings, and with $r$ in the image of $S$. Note that $S$ is a domain (combine this and this), and as $R\\to S$ is faithfully flat and so injective, the generic point of $S$ maps to that of $R$ under $\\mathrm{Spec}(S)\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(R)$. So the extension $\\mathrm{Frac}(S)/\\mathrm{Frac}(R)$ is finite, and so $r$ is algebraic. Conversely, suppose that $r$ in $\\widehat{R}$ is algebraic and let $p(x)\\in R[x]$ be a non-zero polynomial annihilating $r$. Since $\\widehat{R}$ is a domain, the polynomial can have at most $\\deg(p)$ many roots in $\\widehat{R}$. Write this finite set of roots as $r=x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_m$. There exists some $N\\gg 0$ such that $r\\ne x_i\\bmod \\mathfrak{m}^N \\widehat{R}$ for $i\\ne 1$. By Artin approximation there exists some $s$ in $R^h$ which is also a root of $p(x)$ and such that $s=r\\bmod \\mathfrak{m}^M\\widehat{R}$ for some $M\\geqslant N$. But, by set up, we then have that $s=r$. $\\blacksquare$\nRemark 6:\n\n Let us give two applications of this.  First, it lets us give a simple example of an element of $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ not in $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}^h$. In particular, the element $\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty p^{i!}$. It suffices to show that it's not algebraic over $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ and this is fairly elementary (e.g. see An elementary example of a transcendental $p$-adic number by Suter). Second, it lets observe that although $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle$ is Henselian, and contains $\\mathbb{C}[x]_{(x-p)}$, and the two have the same completion, that $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle$ is not $\\mathbb{C}[x]_{(x-p)}^h$. Indeed, it suffices to observe that $\\mathbb{C}\\langle x-p\\rangle$ contains $\\exp(x)$ which is not algebraic over $\\mathbb{C}[x]_{(x-p)}$.", "meta": {"id": 4652524, "source": "stack_exchange", "misc": "{'post_id': 4652524, 'input_score': 29, 'output_score': 42, 'post_title': 'Why are $p$-adic numbers ubiquitous in modern number theory?'}"}}
