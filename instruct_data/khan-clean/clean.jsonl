This means that the remaining 32% of the lizards will have lifespans that fall outside this range.\n\nSince the normal distribution is symmetrical, half of the remaining 32% (16%) will live less than 2.3 years, and the other half (16%) will live longer than 3.5 years.\n\nTherefore, the probability of a particular lizard living longer than 2.3 years is 68% (within 1 standard deviation) plus 16% (beyond 1 standard deviation), which equals 84%. Hence, the estimated probability of a lizard living longer than 2.3 years is 84%."}

Once we find these distances, we can equate them in order to derive the equation of our parabola.\n\nFinding the distances from $(x,y)$ to the focus and the directrix The distance between $(x,y)$ and $(6,-4)$ is $\\sqrt{(x-6)^2+(y+4)^2}$. [How did we find that?] Similarly, the distance between $(x,y)$ and the line $y=-7$ is $\\sqrt{(y+7)^2}$. [How did we know that?]\n\nDeriving the formula by equating the distances $\\begin{aligned} \\sqrt{(y+7)^2} &= \\sqrt{(x-6)^2+(y+4)^2} \\\\\\\\ (y+7)^2 &= (x-6)^2+(y+4)^2 \\\\\\\\ {y^2}+14y{+49} &= (x-6)^2{+y^2}{+8y}+16\\\\\\\\ 14y{-8y}&=(x-6)^2+16{-49} \\\\\\\\ 6y&=(x-6)^2-33 \\\\\\\\ y&=\\dfrac{(x-6)^2}{6}-\\dfrac{11}{2}\\end{aligned}$\n\nThe answer The equation of our parabola is $y=\\dfrac{(x-6)^2}{6}-\\dfrac{11}{2}$.

The second denominator $14y+18$ can be factored as $2(7y+9)$ by factoring out a $2$.\n\nWe can see that both denominators share the factor $(7y+9)$. Only the first denominator has the factor $(7y-9)$. Only the second denominator has the factor $2$. Therefore, the least common multiple is the product of all the above factors. Let's manipulate the expressions to have that denominator: \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\phantom{=}\\dfrac{-y^2}{(7y-9)(7y+9)}+\\dfrac{3y}{2(7y+9)}\\\\\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{-y^2 \\cdot 2}{(7y-9)(7y+9) \\cdot 2}+\\dfrac{3y(7y-9)}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}\\\\\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{-2y^2}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}+\\dfrac{21y^2-27y}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that both denominators are the same, let's add! \n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\dfrac{-2y^2}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}+\\dfrac{21y^2-27y}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{(-2y^2)+(21y^2-27y)}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{-2y^2+21y^2-27y}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}\\\\\n&=\\dfrac{19y^2-27y}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn conclusion, $\\dfrac{-y^2}{49y^2-81}+\\dfrac{3y}{14y+18}=\\dfrac{19y^2-27y}{2(7y-9)(7y+9)}$"}

Each slice of the solid can be represented as a cylinder with a hole in the middle. The volume of each slice is given by $\\pi[(r_1(x))^2-(r_2(x))^2]\\,dx$, where $r_1(x)$ is the distance between the outer radius and the axis of rotation, and $r_2(x)$ is the distance between the inner radius and the axis of rotation.\n\nThe outer radius $r_1(x)$ is the distance between the line $y=4$ and the line $y=-1$, which is $5$. The inner radius $r_2(x)$ is the distance between the curve $y=\\frac{1}{2}x^3$ and the line $y=-1$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}x^3+1$.\n\nThe area of the washer's base is then given by $\\pi[(r_1(x))^2-(r_2(x))^2] = \\pi\\left[ 25-\\left( \\frac{1}{4}x^6+x^3+1 \\right) \\right] = \\pi\\left( -\\frac{1}{4}x^6-x^3+24 \\right)$.\n\nThe interval of integration is $[0,2]$, as the leftmost endpoint of $R$ is at $x=0$ and the rightmost endpoint is at $x=2$. Therefore, the volume of the solid is given by the definite integral $\\int_0^2 \\pi\\left( -\\frac{1}{4}x^6-x^3+24 \\right)dx$.\n\nEvaluating the integral, we find that the volume of the solid is $\\frac{276\\pi}{7}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the volume of the solid generated by rotating $R$ about the line $y=-1$ is $\\frac{276\\pi}{7}$."}

Both sine and cosine can be used to model periodic contexts. We can decide which is better fitting by considering the $y$ -intercept. The sine function intercepts the $y$ -axis at its midline, and the cosine function intercepts the $y$ -axis at its peak. That way, we know Pluto achieved its minimum distance in $1989$, when $u = 0$. Since $\\cos u$ reaches a peak at $0$, we'll use a cosine function to model this situation. Since we want it to achieve a minimum instead of a maximum at $u = 0$, we'll use a negative multiple of cosine.\n\nThe amplitude of Pluto's distance is $\\dfrac{7.4 - 4.4}{2} = 1.5$ billion $\\text{km}$. The period of Pluto's distance is the amount of time between its minima: $2237 - 1989 = 248$ years.
